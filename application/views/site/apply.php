        <h2>Ego</h2> <p>is a project-based DeCal in which students work together to build a web platform. The web platform students will be a feed reader that allows users to receive feeds from almost any kind of web site as well as keywords without having to visit web sites individually. Students will learn how to apply what they have learned in class to a real-world project, and hone teamwork skills that are essential to being a great programmer.</p>

        <h2>People</h2> <p>mainly use Internet to receive information. The problem is, they need to visit individual websites to hear about their interests. It would be much better for users if there was a single hub of information that fetches updates from other websites and deliver the latest news - in one place. This is precisely what Ego will accomplish. Instead of visiting other web sites, you subscribe to them and receive feeds from them. We are going to take things further than what RSS feed readers can accomplish by allowing users to subscribe to not just news and blogs, but forums, shopping malls, and other varieties of websites. In turn, users can receive information all in one place and web administrators can reach their audience faster.</p>

        <h2>Another</h2> <p>feature that Ego will implement is subscription by keyword. When people use Internet, they want to receive information about their "interest," not some specific website. As such, we need to allow users to subscribe to a particular keyword, such as "iPhone" and "Obama." This way, users can directly hear about their interests without even knowing related websites, ex. Engadget.  </p>

    <h1>The Objectives | </h1><br /><br />
    <h2>Students will...</h2><br />
    <div class="list">
    <h2>1. apply </h2> <p>what they have learned in class to a real-world application. Education is more than learning dry theory. Rather, it involves real-world applications, namely group projects like Ego. </p><br /><br />
    <h2>2. learn </h2> <p>how to work in a team. Coding alone and coding in a team is a vastly different experience. Coding alone is like writing an essay for only you to see it. In a group, you need to properly encapsulate your modules, adhere to the framework, etc. As a result, you will learn to become a better programmer, one who is capable of working efficiently in a team - a quality that may be more important than writing a more efficient code.</p><br /><br />
    <h2>3. introduced </h2> <p>to many of the design techniques that are used in software engineering in a large team. Here are the highlights of the techniques students will learn: <h2>MVC (Model-View-Controller) Framework</h2> - Students will be using CodeIgniter PHP framework, which uses MVC architectural pattern in software engineering. In MVC framework, there will be a strict division of labor/concern in application development, namely Model(business logic), View(User Interface), and Controller (User Input). This allows the team to develop independently, test quickly, and manage more efficiently. <h2>Revision Control (Source Control)</h2> - Students will be using GitHub to learn how to work with Git revision control/source code management system. GitHub allows teams to manage large amount of codes efficiently by making sure changes are orderly, keeping track of revision history, creating a set of rules for the team to follow, and managing a backup in case of emergency. </p><br /><br />
    <h2>4. combine</h2> <p>various techniques, including PHP, HTML 5, CSS, jQuery, and XML to create a revolutionary feed reader. We believe this will be a valuable experience for students by participating in an effort to create something new that will help the users, rather than staying as a "user" who uses existing products. </p>

    <div class="caption">
        <h2>Classes</h2> <p>will meet at 7-9PM Tuesday and 6-7PM Thursday, 310 Soda. The course will be comprised of 1 hour discussion and 2 hour lab. In the discussion section, each team will talk about their progress in the goal for the week, and discuss areas of improvements in the project. We will also discuss features to implement in the given week, and talk about how we should implement them, as well as division of labor among teams, etc. In a group lab session, students will break into their teams, and will work on the goal given in a class discussion session. </p>

    <div class="caption">
        <h2>The 2-hour lab</h2> <p>should be an opportunity for students to work on the project with other team members. Students are not expected to finish everything during the lab; instead, students will use the time to meet with his/her team members and work on the project together. Students are encouraged to meet online or offline with the team members to discuss and work on the project throughout the week. There will be weekly assignments that will require the students to implement some features of the Ego project, except the first two weeks, during which students will practice working with GitHub and CodeIgniter MVC Framework. In some weeks, there will be readings to prepare students for the following week's discussion. (ex. If we are going to implement RSS feed system by keywords, we might give a brief reading about how RSS works, as well as some intro to XML. </p>

        <h2>Students</h2> <p>will be divided into five teams of three members each. There will be three to four development teams, comprised of students with strong expertise in web programming (ex. HTML 5, PHP, Javascript), and one to two design teams, comprised of students with strong expertise in web dsign (ex. HTML 5, CSS, Photoshop, and maybe jQuery for dynamic effects). Students will be matched with other team members of various strengths, so that students can learn from other members and utilize each other's strengths for the team's advantage. Students are expected to know at least two of: HTML 5, PHP, Javascript, and Python for Development, and HTML 5, CSS, Photoshop, and jQuery for Design Team. </p>
