<p>
	THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Gracias!&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Thank you so much.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Everybody please have a seat.&nbsp; Ah, it is good to be back at NALEO.&nbsp; Qu&eacute; placer estar aqu&iacute; con tantos amigos.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; It is wonderful to see a lot of good friends from all across the country.&nbsp; It is nice to be at Disney World.&nbsp; This is now the second time I&#39;ve come to Disney World without my daughters.&nbsp; They are not happy with me.&nbsp; (Laughter.)<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	I want to thank Secretary Solis for the introduction, and for her hard work.&nbsp; She is one of the best Labor Secretaries we have ever had and she is thinking about you each and every day.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; I want to thank Sylvia and Arturo for their outstanding leadership.&nbsp; Arturo, happy early birthday.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; I will not sing -- don&#39;t worry.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; Welcome to the other side of the hill.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	And it is especially good to have Ambassador Mari Carmen Aponte here with us.&nbsp; We are very proud of her.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; When the Senate refused to confirm Mari, I sent her to El Salvador anyway -- (laughter) -- because I knew she was going to do an outstanding job.&nbsp; And she has.&nbsp; And I&#39;m glad to see the Senate finally confirmed her last week.&nbsp; So she&#39;s now official.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	Last but not least, I want to thank all of you.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s always nice to get out of Washington.&nbsp; It&#39;s nice to get a little Florida sunshine.&nbsp; But it&#39;s especially nice to see folks who have devoted themselves to serving their communities and their country -- who&rsquo;ve dedicated themselves to making people&rsquo;s lives just a little bit better each and every day, at every level -- school board, state legislatures, county boards.&nbsp; You guys are where the rubber hits the road.&nbsp; And I&#39;ve had a chance to see many of you in your local communities and hear the stories of all your efforts and all your hopes and all your dreams -- and also some of your frustrations and the hardships that are taking place.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	Yesterday, your featured speaker came here and said that the election in November isn&rsquo;t about two people.&nbsp; It&#39;s not about being a Republican or a Democrat or an independent.&nbsp; It is about the future of America.&nbsp; And while we&rsquo;ve got a lot of differences, he and I, on this point I could not agree more.&nbsp; This is about America&rsquo;s future.&nbsp; The defining issue of our time is whether we carry forward the promise that has drawn generations of immigrants to our shores, from every corner of the globe, sometimes at great risk -- men and women drawn by the promise that no matter who you are, no matter what you look like, no matter where you come from, no matter what your last name, this is a place where you can make it if you try.&nbsp; This is a place where you can make it if you try.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	And whether our ancestors arrived on the Mayflower or were brought here on slave ships, whether they signed in at Ellis Island or they crossed the Rio Grande, their diversity has not only enriched this country, it helped build the greatest economic engine the world has ever known.&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	Hungry people, striving people, dreamers, risk-takers.&nbsp; People don&rsquo;t come here looking for handouts.&nbsp; We are a nation of strivers and climbers and entrepreneurs -- the hardest-working people on Earth.&nbsp; And nobody personifies these American values, these American traits, more than the Latino community.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the essence of who you are.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	All we ask for is that hard work pays off, that responsibility is rewarded, so that if these men and women put in enough effort, they can find a good job, own their own home, send their kids to college -- let their kids dream even bigger&nbsp; -- put away a little bit for retirement, not go bankrupt when you get sick.<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	And I ran for this office because for more than a decade, that dream had been slipping away from too many Americans.&nbsp; Before I even took office, the worst economic crisis of our lifetimes pushed it even further from reach -- particularly for a lot of Latino communities, which had already faced higher unemployment and higher poverty rates.&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	So the question is not whether we need to do better.&nbsp; Of course the economy isn&rsquo;t where it needs to be.&nbsp; Of course there&#39;s still too many who struggle.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve got so much more work to do.&nbsp; But the question is:&nbsp; How do we make the economy grow faster?&nbsp; How do we create more jobs?&nbsp; How do we create more opportunity?&nbsp; The question is:&nbsp; What vision are we going to stand up for?&nbsp; Who are we going to fight for?&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	That&rsquo;s what we have to decide right now.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what this election is about.&nbsp; Who are we fighting for?&nbsp; What vision of America do we believe in?<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	If America is about anything, it&rsquo;s about passing on even greater opportunity to our children.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s about education.&nbsp; And that&rsquo;s why I expanded Pell Grants -- which will give an additional 150,000 children in the Latino community a chance to go to college.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve invested in our community colleges, which are a gateway to a good job for so many Hispanic Americans -- Americans of every stripe.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	That&rsquo;s why schools in almost every state -- some in the toughest neighborhoods around -- have answered our challenge to raise their standards for teaching and learning -- not by teaching to a test, but by expanding creativity, and improving curriculums, and focusing more on kids who are hardest to reach so that we give every child a fighting chance.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s part of the vision of America that we believe in.<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	In this country, we believe that if you want to take a risk on a new idea, you should have the chance to succeed.&nbsp; And you shouldn&rsquo;t have to have wealthy parents in order to be successful.&nbsp; Latino-owned businesses have been the fastest-growing small businesses, and we&rsquo;ve cut their taxes 18 times.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve expanded new loans and new credit so they can grow and they can hire.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the vision we believe in.<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	In America, we believe you shouldn&rsquo;t go broke because you get sick.&nbsp; Hardworking people out there -- sometimes two jobs, three jobs -- still don&rsquo;t have health insurance.&nbsp; If you did have health insurance, insurance companies were able to discriminate against certain patients.&nbsp; That was wrong.&nbsp; It was wrong to let insurance companies just jack up premiums for no reason, and to have millions of working Americans uninsured --&nbsp; with the Latino community having the highest rate of uninsured of any community in the country.&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	So after a century of trying, we finally passed reform that will make health care affordable and available for every American.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; That was the right thing to do.&nbsp; That was the right thing to do.&nbsp; That was the right thing to do.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	Now, we&rsquo;re not done yet.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve got more to do.&nbsp; We need to put more good teachers in our classrooms.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; We need to get colleges and universities to bring down the cost of tuition to make it more affordable for more young people.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	We need to invest in new research and innovation -- especially new sources of energy and high-tech manufacturing.&nbsp; We need to put people back to work rebuilding our roads and our highways and our runways.&nbsp; Construction jobs can have a huge ripple effect in communities all across the country.&nbsp; And nobody knows it better than state and local officials.&nbsp; You know the difference it makes.&nbsp; And with the housing bubble bursting, we&rsquo;ve got tens of thousands of construction workers just ready and eager to get to work.&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	We need to give families in hard-hit housing markets like Florida and Nevada the chance to refinance and save $3,000 a year on their mortgage.&nbsp; That&#39;s good for those families.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s good for the housing market.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s good for the surrounding community.&nbsp; There&#39;s no reason why Congress hasn&rsquo;t already done it.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	Instead of just talking a big game about &quot;job creators,&quot; we should give small business owners a tax break for hiring more workers or for paying higher wages.&nbsp; Instead of rewarding companies that ship jobs overseas, we should take that money and use it to cover moving expenses for companies who are bringing jobs back to America.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	On almost every issue of concern to your community, to every community, what&rsquo;s holding us back isn&rsquo;t a lack of big ideas.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not a lack of technical solutions.&nbsp; By now, just about every policy and proposal has been laid out on the table.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s holding us back is a stalemate -- a stalemate in Washington between two fundamentally different views of which direction we should go.&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	The Republicans who run Congress, the man at the top of their ticket, they don&rsquo;t agree with any of the proposals I just talked about.&nbsp; They believe the best way to grow the economy is from the top down.&nbsp; So they want to roll back regulations, and give insurance companies and credit card companies and mortgage lenders even more power to do as they please.&nbsp; They want to spend $5 trillion on new tax cuts -- including a 25-percent tax cut for every millionaire in the country.&nbsp; And they want to pay for it by raising middle-class taxes and gutting middle-class priorities like education and training and health care and medical research.&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	And that&rsquo;s it.&nbsp; That&#39;s it.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s their economic plan.&nbsp; When they tell you they can do better, that&rsquo;s their idea of doing better.&nbsp; When they tell you they know how to fix the economy, that&rsquo;s exactly how they plan to do it.&nbsp; And I think they&rsquo;re wrong.&nbsp; I think they&rsquo;re wrong.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	In this country, prosperity has never come from the top down -- it comes from a strong and growing middle class, and creating ladders of opportunity for all those who are striving to get into the middle class.&nbsp; It comes from successful, thriving small businesses that over time grow into medium-size and then large businesses.&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	We don&rsquo;t need more top-down economics.&nbsp; What we need is a better plan for education and training, and energy independence, and innovation, and infrastructure that can rebuild America.&nbsp; What we need is a tax code that encourages companies to create jobs and manufacturing here in the United States, and, yes, asks the wealthiest Americans to help pay down the deficit.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; That&#39;s what&#39;s needed.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	And what&#39;s also needed is immigration reform that finally lives up to our heritage as a nation of laws and as a nation of immigrants, and continues the American story of renewal and energy and dynamism that&#39;s made us who we are.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	I mean, think about it.&nbsp; You and I both know one of America&rsquo;s greatest strengths has always been our ability to attract talented, hardworking people who believe in this country, who want to help make it stronger.&nbsp; That&#39;s what keeps us young.&nbsp; That&#39;s what keeps us dynamic and energized.&nbsp; That&#39;s what makes us who we are.&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
	But our current immigration system doesn&rsquo;t reflect those values.&nbsp; It allows the best and brightest to study here, but then tells them to leave, start companies somewhere else.&nbsp; It punishes immigrants and businesses who play by the rules, and fails to address the fact that there are too many who don&rsquo;t.&nbsp; It separates families and it denies innocent young people the chance to earn an education or serve in the uniform of the country they love.<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	Now, once again, the problem is not the lack of technical solutions.&nbsp; We know what the solutions are to this challenge.&nbsp; Just six years ago, an unlikely trio -- John McCain, Ted Kennedy, President Bush -- came together to champion comprehensive immigration reform.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; I, along with a lot of Democrats, were proud to join 23 Senate Republicans in voting for it.&nbsp; Today, those same Republicans have been driven away from the table by a small faction of their own party.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s created the same kind of stalemate on immigration reform that we&rsquo;re seeing on a whole range of other economic issues.&nbsp; And it has given rise to a patchwork of state laws that cause more problems than they solve and are often doing more harm than good.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	Now, this makes no sense.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not good for America.&nbsp; And as long as I am President of the United States, I will not give up the fight to change it.&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	In the face of a Congress that refuses to do anything on immigration, I&rsquo;ve said that I&rsquo;ll take action wherever I can.&nbsp; So my administration has been doing what we can, without the help in Congress, for more than three years now.&nbsp; And last week, we took another step.&nbsp; On Friday, we announced that we&rsquo;re lifting the shadow of deportation from deserving young people who were brought to this country as children.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	We should have passed the DREAM Act a long time ago.&nbsp; It was written by members of both parties.&nbsp; When it came up for a vote a year and a half ago, Republicans in Congress blocked it.&nbsp; The bill hadn&rsquo;t changed.&nbsp; The need hadn&rsquo;t changed.&nbsp; The only thing that had changed was politics.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; The need had not changed.&nbsp; The bill hadn&rsquo;t changed -- written with Republicans.&nbsp; The only thing that had changed was politics.&nbsp; And I refused to keep looking young people in the eye, deserving young people in the eye, and tell them, tough luck, the politics is too hard.&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	I&rsquo;ve met these young people all across the country.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re studying in our schools.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re playing with our children, pledging allegiance to our flag, hoping to serve our country.&nbsp; They are Americans in their hearts, in their minds. They are Americans through and through -- in every single way but on paper.&nbsp; And all they want is to go to college and give back to the country they love.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; So lifting the shadow of deportation and giving them a reason to hope -- that was the right thing to do.&nbsp; It was the right thing to do.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	It&rsquo;s not amnesty.&nbsp; It falls short of where we need to be --a path to citizenship.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not a permanent fix.&nbsp; This is a temporary measure that lets us focus our resources wisely while offering some justice to these young people.&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s precisely because it&rsquo;s temporary, Congress still needs to come up with a long-term immigration solution -- rather than argue that we did this the wrong way or for the wrong reasons.&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	So to those who are saying Congress should be the one to fix this -- absolutely.&nbsp; For those who say we should do this in a bipartisan fashion -- absolutely.&nbsp; My door has been open for three and a half years.&nbsp; They know where to find me.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	I&rsquo;ve said time and again:&nbsp; Send me the DREAM Act; I will sign it right away.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; And I&rsquo;m still willing to work with anyone from either party who is committed to real reform.&nbsp; But in the meantime, the question we should consider is this:&nbsp; Was providing these young people with the opportunity for a temporary measure of relief the right thing to do?<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	AUDIENCE MEMBERS:&nbsp; Yes!<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; I think it was.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s long past time that we gave them a sense of hope.&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	Your speaker from yesterday has a different view.&nbsp; In his speech, he said that when he makes a promise to you, he&rsquo;ll keep it.&nbsp; Well, he has promised to veto the DREAM Act, and we should take him at his word.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; I&rsquo;m just saying.&nbsp; (Laughter and applause.)&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	And I believe that would be a tragic mistake.&nbsp; You do, too.&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	On all these issues -- on the investments we need to grow the middle class and leave a better future for our kids, on deficit reduction that&rsquo;s fair and balanced, on immigration reform, on consumer financial protection so that people aren&rsquo;t exploited, whether at a payday loan shop or if they&rsquo;re sending remittances back to their families -- on all these issues, Washington has a long way to go to catch up with the rest of the country.&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	The whole idea behind the DREAM Act, after all, was inspired by a music teacher in Illinois.&nbsp; She decided to call her Senator, Dick Durbin, when she discovered that one of her own students was forced to live in the shadows.&nbsp; But even as that idea fell prey to gridlock and game-playing in Washington, it gained momentum in the rest of the country:&nbsp; From every student who marched and organized to keep their classmates from being deported; from every parent who discovered the truth about the child down the street and chose to stand up for them -- because these are all our kids; from every American who stood up and spoke out across the country because they saw a wrong and wanted it to be righted; who put their shoulder to the wheel and moved us a little closer towards justice.&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	That&rsquo;s what has always moved us forward.&nbsp; It doesn&rsquo;t start in Washington.&nbsp; It starts with a million quiet heroes who love their country and believe they can change it.&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	We all have different backgrounds.&nbsp; We all have different political beliefs.&nbsp; The Latino community is not monolithic; the African American community is not all of one mind.&nbsp; This is a big country.&nbsp; And sometimes, in tough times, in a country this big and busy, especially during a political year, those differences are cast in a bright spotlight.<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	But I ran for this office because I am absolutely convinced that what binds us together has always proven stronger than what drives us apart.&nbsp; We are one people.&nbsp; We need one another.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Our patriotism is rooted not in race, not in ethnicity, not in creed; it is based on a shared belief in the enduring and permanent promise of America.<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	That&rsquo;s the promise that draws so many talented, driven people to these shores.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the promise that drew my own father here.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the promise that drew your parents or grandparents or great grandparents -- generations of people who dreamed of a place where knowledge and opportunity were available to anybody who was willing to work for it, anybody who was willing to seize it.&nbsp; A place where there was no limit to how far you could go, how high you could climb.&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	They took a chance.&nbsp; And America embraced their drive and embraced their courage -- said, &quot;Come, you&rsquo;re welcome.&quot;&nbsp; This is who we are.<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	Every single day I walk into the Oval Office, every day that I have this extraordinary privilege of being your President, I will always remember that in no other nation on Earth could my story even be possible.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; That&rsquo;s something I celebrate.&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	That&rsquo;s what drives me, in every decision I make, to try and widen the circle of opportunity, to fight for that big and generous and optimistic country we inherited, to carry that dream forward for generations to come.&nbsp; Because when I meet these young people, all throughout communities, I see myself.&nbsp; Who knows what they might achieve.&nbsp; I see my daughters and my nieces and my nephews.&nbsp; Who knows what they might achieve if we just give them a chance?&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m fighting for.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what I stand for.&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	This fight will not always be easy.&nbsp; It hasn&rsquo;t always been easy.&nbsp; It will not happen overnight.&nbsp; Our history has been one where that march towards justice and freedom and equality has taken time.&nbsp; There will always be plenty of stubborn opposition in the way that says: &quot;No, you can&rsquo;t.&quot; &quot;No, you shouldn&rsquo;t.&quot;&nbsp; &quot;Don&rsquo;t even try.&quot;<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	But America was built by people who said something different -- who said:&nbsp; &quot;Yes, we can.&quot;&nbsp; Who said, &quot;S&iacute;, se puede.&quot;&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; And as long as I have the privilege of being your President, I will be alongside you, fighting for the country that we together dream of.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	God bless you.&nbsp; Thank you, NALEO.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; God bless the United States of America.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br />

	Aboard Air Force One<br />
	En Route Orlando, Florida</p>
<p>
	10:49 A.M. EDT</p>
<p>
	MR. EARNEST: Good morning, everybody. Welcome aboard Air Force One as we wing our way to the Sunshine State. I have some brief opening remarks, and then we&#39;ll open it up to questions.</p>
<p>
	In Orlando this afternoon, the President will speak to NALEO about his efforts to help America&#39;s middle-class families and America&#39;s economy recover from the worst recession since the Great Depression. He&#39;ll note that we&#39;ve made progress but we have a long way to go, and he&#39;s continuing to push Congress to act on legislation that will support our economy, support responsible homeowners, and put construction workers, first responders and teachers back to work.</p>
<p>
	I&#39;ll note some statistics recently cited by the Republican Party of Florida that bear out the progress that we&#39;ve made and the work that remains to be done. Specifically, the Florida Republicans note that the unemployment rate in Florida has declined for 11 consecutive months and that more than 99,000 private sector jobs have been created in Florida alone over the last year and a half.</p>
<p>
	Yet the President is not satisfied. And unfortunately for our economy, Republicans in Congress won&#39;t act on legislation submitted by the President that would put by our estimates -- or by some estimates, I should say -- these are actually outside estimates -- 1 million people back to work. This stalemate isn&#39;t good for our economy, but it reflects the choice in this election.</p>
<p>
	The President believes we need economic policies, tax policies, and, yes, even immigration policies, that prioritizes the interests of middle-class families and where everyone in this country gets a fair shot and everyone plays by the same set of rules. Republicans merely want to double down on the economic policies like large tax cuts for the wealthy that led to the economic downturn in the first place.</p>
<p>
	So you can anticipate hearing more about those issues today, both in Orlando and in Tampa.</p>
<p>
	Q Do you anticipate the President laying out his vision for immigration reform beyond what he&#39;s already announced today?</p>
<p>
	MR. EARNEST: Well, I&#39;ll let the President&#39;s remarks speak for themselves, but you can certainly anticipate that the President will talk broadly about his efforts to strengthen middle-class families all across the country in terms of Wall Street reform that will protect the interests of middle-class families including Hispanic families; health care reform that has lowered health care costs and ensured access to health care for middle-class families all across the country, including many Hispanic families; and he&#39;ll also talk about immigration reform as well.</p>
<p>
	I think somebody&#39;s tape recorder may be playing instead of recording. I heard a little feedback. Sorry about that.</p>
<p>
	Q So no more specifics then on immigration reform going ahead?</p>
<p>
	MR. EARNEST: Tune in.</p>
<p>
	Q Josh, four years ago the President spoke to NALEO and that&#39;s when he said that immigration reform was going to be his priority from day one. And here we are four years later; what you have is just what the President did last Friday. What more can he -- will he make that pledge again to NALEO today that immigration reform will be his top priority starting in the new administration?</p>
<p>
	MR. EARNEST: Well, I don&#39;t want to say anything further to preview the President&#39;s remarks. But I will say that the President&#39;s record of prioritizing comprehensive immigration reform speaks for itself. Unfortunately, that&rsquo;s a priority that&rsquo;s been blocked time and time again by Republicans in Congress.</p>
<p>
	Republicans, over the last three years, have repeatedly blocked efforts to pass the DREAM Act specifically. But there are other efforts related to comprehensive immigration reform that have historically been supported by Republicans. John McCain has typically voiced support for those kinds of efforts in the past. Former President Bush, when he was in office, spent some time advocating for comprehensive immigration reform. These are the kinds of things where we should be able to build bipartisan support. But since the President took office, while he&rsquo;s continued to make it a priority, Republicans have made it a priority to block those efforts at every turn.</p>
<p>
	Q The President is speaking about two hours after Marco Rubio speaks to NALEO. Has he reached out to Senator Rubio at all given the similarity between the Senator&rsquo;s proposal and what the President did?</p>
<p>
	MR. EARNEST: I don&rsquo;t know of any calls at this point. I can check on that for you, though.</p>
<p>
	Q The last time the Democrats tried to pass anything on immigration was in December 2010, right -- the DREAM Act. What do you say to people wondering why the President didn&rsquo;t move faster on this new deportation policy and save a lot of people a lot of grief in the past year and a half -- some young kids, anyway?</p>
<p>
	MR. EARNEST: Well, I&rsquo;d refer you to my colleagues at DHS who can give you the background. There have been a series of policy decisions that have been made at DHS to streamline our immigration enforcement policies, to ensure that they align cleanly with our values, but also to ensure that we have an immigration enforcement system that operates effectively and efficiently.</p>
<p>
	And the directive that was issued by the Secretary of Homeland Security last week clarifies that dedicating significant resources to enforcing those policies against people who were brought to this nation as a child and who are currently -- who don&rsquo;t currently pose a threat to their communities, haven&rsquo;t -- aren&rsquo;t wanted for -- well, I should say don&rsquo;t pose a threat to their communities, that&rsquo;s not an efficient use or an effective use of our immigration enforcement resources.</p>
<p>
	So that&rsquo;s the reason that the Secretary issued the directive that she did. And that builds on a record of policy-making that they have at the Department of Homeland Security about how best to use the enforcement -- the immigration enforcement resources that they have.</p>
<p>
	So the President was obviously pleased with that announcement and spoke about it at the Rose Garden ceremony last week. But the President said on Friday, and has said consistently, that that directive related to the enforcement of immigration policies does not -- is not a substitute for congressional action; it&rsquo;s not a substitute for a permanent solution to our broken immigration system.</p>
<p>
	Q Change of subjects. Can you update us on Holder and the Hill?</p>
<p>
	MR. EARNEST: Well, in terms of a specific update I would refer you to my colleagues at the Department of Justice who have been working on this issue for some time. As you know, this is something that they&rsquo;ve been working on with congressional Republicans for 14 months. There have been nearly a dozen hearings with the Attorney General or other Department of Justice officials. They have turned over 7,600 pages of documents. So this is an ongoing process.</p>
<p>
	It&rsquo;s also apparent that Republicans are succeeding in a strategy that they laid out for all of you at the beginning of last year, where they vowed to use their investigative powers to score political points against the administration and to further obstruct the President&rsquo;s legislative agenda. It&rsquo;s unfortunate that they&rsquo;ve chosen to use their authorities in this way to promote this stalemate. But despite that, despite that calculated strategy on their part, we remain committed to trying to find a constructive solution.</p>
<p>
	Q Are you aware of the last time the President spoke to the Attorney General, last night or this morning? Do you know the last time they spoke? And then, secondly, actress Jane Lynch was spotted at the White House this morning. Do you have any more on that?</p>
<p>
	MR. EARNEST: I don&#39;t have any information about the last time the President spoke to the Attorney General. I know that they&rsquo;re in touch regularly on a whole range of issues and responsibilities that the Attorney General has. I don&#39;t know the last time that they had a conversation.</p>
<p>
	In terms of Jane Lynch, I wasn&rsquo;t at the -- I was actually already onboard Air Force One when she was at the White House. So one of my colleagues at the White House should be able to fill you in on why she was there.</p>
<p>
	Q Josh, are there any negotiations going on either today or planned throughout the weekend before the vote on contempt?</p>
<p>
	MR. EARNEST: Well, I&rsquo;d refer you to the Department of Justice on that. But I --</p>
<p>
	Q Do you know --</p>
<p>
	MR. EARNEST: I don&#39;t know of anything specific, but the Department of Justice is handling that matter, as they should.</p>
<p>
	Q Is the President confident that he can avoid a House vote on contempt, or is that inevitable?</p>
<p>
	MR. EARNEST: Well, I don&#39;t know if it&rsquo;s inevitable. There&#39;s a Republican majority in the House of Representatives, and they seem hell-bent on using their investigative powers to promote a political stalemate and obstruct the President&rsquo;s agenda and score political points. That&#39;s unfortunate, but that&#39;s a strategy that they laid out for all of you at the beginning of last year. So it&rsquo;s unfortunate, but not particularly surprising.</p>
<p>
	Q Josh, the Post reported today that while he was the head of Bain Capital, Mitt Romney and the company invested in other companies that would outsource jobs overseas to China and India. Does the White House believe that that undercuts Romney&rsquo;s sort of core -- sort of credentials for the -- that he&rsquo;s been touting for the job? And will you press him harder on that? Will the President be talking about this specifically as he goes forward on both the campaign and other events that he does?</p>
<p>
	MR. EARNEST: Well, I understand that my colleagues at the campaign are going to have a little more to say about this this morning. What I will say for you, though, is I do think that it is an apt illustration of the differing approaches advocated in this election for strengthening our economy.</p>
<p>
	The President -- you just laid out for us the story that appeared in the Post that laid out the approach that Mr. Romney took when he was in the private sector. The President has been advocating an approach that is 100 degrees -- 180 degrees different from that, which is the President believes that we need to realign our tax policies so that we no longer provide incentives to companies who ship jobs overseas, and in fact we should implement tax policies that encourage companies to invest in America, to invest in facilities here, and to create jobs in America.</p>
<p>
	So there&#39;s a pretty -- there&#39;s no question there&#39;s a pretty stark difference between the values and approaches of the two candidates on that issue specifically.</p>
<p>
	Q Will the White House be doing stuff to -- will the campaign be doing stuff to sort of highlight that even more later?<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	MR. EARNEST: You should check with them on that.</p>
<p>
	Q Will the President talk about this today?</p>
<p>
	MR. EARNEST: I don&#39;t have anything to preview for you at this point.</p>
<p>
	Q Oh, go ahead. (Laughter.)</p>
<p>
	MR. EARNEST: If I&rsquo;m able to later today, I will, but I don&#39;t know if I&rsquo;ll be able to give you any heads-up on that.</p>
<p>
	Q Josh, do you have any more on the Wall Street Journal report that claimed that there might have been some ethical -- a bad ethical situation between David Axelrod&rsquo;s firm and health care as the negotiations were going on? There were new emails that were released. I know you guys have said it was an old issue that was brought up, but the emails newly released kind of bring light to it. Were there any ethical problems there, as the report --</p>
<p>
	MR. EARNEST: I saw the report that you&rsquo;re referring to, and there&#39;s -- I disagree with your contention that there&#39;s anything new there. This was reported extensively two years ago that Mr. Axelrod was not involved in any way in the contract between AKDP and PhRMA on the issue of health care reform. And there&rsquo;s nothing new that was reported in the Wall Street Journal or anywhere else that sheds anything -- that sheds any new light on that.</p>
<p>
	Q Josh, do you have any response to Moody&rsquo;s downgrades of a number of banks today? I mean, how big of a deal do you see that?</p>
<p>
	MR. EARNEST: Well, I saw those reports this morning as well. As you know, we don&rsquo;t typically comment on the individual decisions of a specific ratings agency. What I can say is that the American banking system today is stronger and more stable as a result of the President&rsquo;s efforts to push for strong reforms in the Dodd-Frank legislation. But the kinds of reforms, including things like higher capital requirements for banks, makes it less likely that taxpayers would be on the hook as a result of a bank failure, but adds strength to the system more generally because of those reforms.</p>
<p>
	But in terms of the individual action taken today, I don&rsquo;t have a specific comment on it.</p>
<p>
	Q Josh, there&rsquo;s been a couple new books in the works that I think are close to being published; they&rsquo;re excerpted both in The New York Times and The Washington Post. One was about Michelle Obama&rsquo;s ancestry and family history, and the other about the President and his youth. And I&rsquo;m wondering if the White House is -- I can be more specific if you need -- but I&rsquo;m wondering if the White House knows if the President has read those books and -- or the excerpts of those books, I should say, and what his reaction is. And Michelle Obama, if she&rsquo;s read it -- the same question.</p>
<p>
	MR. EARNEST: I don&rsquo;t know if they&rsquo;ve -- to be honest with you, I don&rsquo;t know if they&rsquo;ve seen those excerpts or not.</p>
<p>
	Q Does the White House generally have a response about the books? I mean, they both raise some interesting questions, both about racial issues, but also about -- in particular, the book about the President, about his -- sort of his own biography, Dreams of My Father, and some of the anecdotes he brought up. It sort of raises some questions about sort of the accuracy of some of those, even beyond maybe what the President acknowledged at the foreword of that book, about some of the composite characters.</p>
<p>
	MR. EARNEST: Well, I&rsquo;m not sure about that last part. I mean, the President was pretty candid in the foreward of the book, as you point out, that he was using a narrative to try to tell a story that did reflect his life. But he was very candid and upfront, literally -- actually, in this case, by writing it in the foreward -- about how the story was told.</p>
<p>
	And I think Mr. Marannis himself, in fact, talked about that, and talked about the differing approaches that the two took to telling the story, and that both have been candid about the approach that they&rsquo;ve taken in that regard. But in terms of -- I would refer you to the specific language in the foreward of the book, because the President really is pretty -- was explicit at the time that he wrote the book about the kind of techniques that he used to tell that story.</p>
<p>
	Q And you have no comment -- no knowledge or comment about whether they&rsquo;ve seen the book? You don&rsquo;t know --</p>
<p>
	MR. EARNEST: I haven&rsquo;t talked to him about that.</p>
<p>
	Q Josh, there&rsquo;s a story in the AP today about frustration among military and intelligence officials about attacks by militants on U.S. troops in Afghanistan who then flee to Pakistan. How firm is the President about not using U.S. troops on the ground to chase those militants into Pakistan?</p>
<p>
	MR. EARNEST: Well, I&#39;m not in a position to comment on the specifics that were included in that AP report today. But our concern about militants using Pakistan as a safe haven from which to launch attacks against our forces are well known. That&#39;s something that we raise both publicly and privately with the Pakistani government.</p>
<p>
	We&#39;ll take steps necessary to mitigate that threat. We value our relationship with Pakistan and we&#39;ll continue to find ways to work together to combat those terrorist groups that pose a threat both to the United States forces, but also to innocent Pakistani civilians.</p>
<p>
	Q When you say you&#39;ll take steps to mitigate that threat, does that mean that you could potentially send U.S. soldiers across the border to chase down those militants?</p>
<p>
	MR. EARNEST: I won&#39;t preview the kinds of things that are being discussed, and frankly, whether or not they&#39;re even being discussed by the administration. But I can tell you that this is something -- this threat is something that we have talked about quite extensively both publicly and privately. It&#39;s something that we have raised with the Pakistanis and we remain committed to finding ways to work with them to combat the threat that these groups pose both to U.S. forces, but also to innocent Pakistani civilians.</p>
<p>
	Q -- if the President read or watched any of Romney&#39;s speech yesterday to NALEO, to the same group? Did he watch that? And then also, did he watch the basketball game last night, and any reaction to the outcome?</p>
<p>
	MR. EARNEST: I don&#39;t know if the President watched all of Mr. Romney&#39;s speech. Frankly, I doubt that he did. But I&#39;m sure that he&#39;s seen news reports of it this morning. And I don&#39;t know about the basketball game, actually. I will circle back with you guys on whether or not he watched the basketball game or whether he had a specific reaction to the game.</p>
<p>
	Q -- speak to NALEO today, and it comes on his reports that he&#39;s looking to scrub the voter roles. Some Democrats are suggesting that that&#39;s an attempt to get rid of Hispanic voters. Does the President have that concern, specifically in Florida, but also in other states --</p>
<p>
	MR. EARNEST: Well, I can tell you as a general matter, not specifically related to the Florida activities, that the President does believe strongly in protecting the right of citizens to vote and cast a ballot in an election, particularly in an election that&#39;s as important as this.</p>
<p>
	I know that the Department of Justice has been working with the state of Florida on this -- I know that they&#39;ve actually raised some serious concerns about this as well. And I&#39;d refer you to them for the specifics of those concerns.</p>
<p>
	Q Can they sue them?</p>
<p>
	MR. EARNEST: I don&#39;t know exactly where they stand in terms of -- on that process, but I know that serious and specific concerns have been made. But for more details, like where they stand in the legal proceedings, I&#39;d refer you to my colleagues at the Department of Justice.</p>
<p>
	Okay? All right, thanks, everybody. Enjoy the ride.</p>

	TEXT OF A LETTER FROM THE PRESIDENT TO THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES AND THE PRESIDENT OF THE SENATE</p>
<p class="rtecenter">
	June 22, 2012</p>
<p>
	Dear Mr. Speaker:&nbsp;(Dear Mr. President:)</p>
<p>
	Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, within 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President publishes in the <em>Federal Register</em> and transmits to the Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the anniversary date.&nbsp; In accordance with this provision, I have sent to the <em>Federal Register</em> for publication the enclosed notice stating that the Western Balkans emergency is to continue in effect beyond June 26, 2012.</p>
<p>
	The crisis constituted by the actions of persons engaged in, or assisting, sponsoring, or supporting (i) extremist violence in the Republic of Macedonia and elsewhere in the Western Balkans region, or (ii) acts obstructing implementation of the Dayton Accords in Bosnia, United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 of June 10, 1999, in Kosovo, or the Ohrid Framework Agreement of 2001 in Macedonia, that led to the declaration of a national emergency on June 26, 2001, in Executive Order 13219, and to the amendment of that order in Executive Order 13304 of May 28, 2003, has not been resolved.&nbsp; The acts of extremist violence and obstructionist activity outlined in Executive Order 13219, as amended, are hostile to U.S. interests and continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States.&nbsp; For these reasons, I have determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency declared with respect to the Western Balkans and maintain in force the sanctions to respond to this threat.</p>
<p>
	Sincerely,</p>
<p class="rtecenter">

	NOTICE</p>
<p class="rtecenter">
	CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO THE WESTERN BALKANS</p>
<p>
	On June 26, 2001, by Executive Order 13219, the President declared a national emergency with respect to the Western Balkans, pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706), to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States constituted by the actions of persons engaged in, or assisting, sponsoring, or supporting (i) extremist violence in the Republic of Macedonia and elsewhere in the Western Balkans region, or (ii) acts obstructing implementation of the Dayton Accords in Bosnia or United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 of June 10, 1999, in Kosovo.&nbsp; The President subsequently amended that order in Executive Order 13304 of May 28, 2003.</p>
<p>
	Because the actions of persons threatening the peace and international stabilization efforts in the Western Balkans continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States, the national emergency declared on June 26, 2001, and the measures adopted on that date and thereafter to deal with that emergency, must continue in effect beyond June 26, 2012.&nbsp; Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency with respect to the Western Balkans.</p>
<p>
	This notice shall be published in the <em>Federal Register</em> and transmitted to the Congress.</p>

	On June 22, 1999, the Supreme Court ruled in <em>Olmstead</em> v.<em>L.C</em>. that the unjustified institutional isolation of people with disabilities is a form of unlawful discrimination under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).&nbsp; The Obama Administration has made significant progress continuing to enforce <em>Olmstead </em>as well as more broadly helping to level the playing field for people with disabilities.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;<em>Olmstead</em> affirmed the rights of Americans with disabilities to live in their communities,&rdquo; said President Obama.&nbsp; &ldquo;As we mark the anniversary of this historic civil rights decision, we reaffirm our commitment to fighting discrimination, and to addressing the needs and concerns of those living with disabilities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	In April of this year, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2012pres/04/20120416a.html">announced the creation</a>&nbsp;of the <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/acl/">Administration for Community Living</a>&nbsp;(ACL), which brings together key HHS organizations and offices dedicated to improving the lives of those with functional &nbsp;needs into one coordinated, focused and stronger entity.&nbsp; ACL combined the Administration on Aging, the Office on Disability and the Administration on Developmental Disabilities into a single agency that supports both cross-cutting initiatives and efforts focused on the unique needs of individual groups, such as children with developmental disabilities or seniors with dementia. This agency will work on increasing access to community supports and achieving full community participation for people with disabilities and seniors.</p>
<p>
	HHS also has worked closely with the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to develop and subsidize rental housing for very low-income adults with disabilities and implement the new Section 811 Project Rental Assistance Program, which will assist extremely low-income adults with disabilities in accessing integrated affordable housing.&nbsp; Last month, HUD <a href="http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/press/press_releases_media_advisories/2012/HUDNo.12-084">announced</a>&nbsp;a new $85 million funding opportunity under the Section 811 program for state housing agencies that meet certain eligibility criteria, including having a partnership with a state health and human services agency and Medicaid agency, to provide essential support and services&nbsp; that help people live in integrated settings in the community.&nbsp; This funding opportunity works to align critical health and housing services and aims to assure integration by promoting Medicaid efforts to serve people in the most appropriate integrated setting.</p>
<p>
	The Department of Justice also continues to enforce the ADA and <em>Olmstead</em>.&nbsp; Over the last three years, the Civil Rights Division at the Department has been involved in more than 40 <em>Olmstead</em> matters in 25 states.&nbsp;&nbsp; Recently, in Virginia, the Department entered into a landmark <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2012/January/12-crt-111.html">settlement agreement</a>&nbsp;with the Commonwealth, which will shift Virginia&rsquo;s developmental disabilities system from one heavily reliant on large, state-run institutions to one focused on safe, individualized, and community-based services that promote integration, independence and full participation by people with disabilities in community life. The agreement expands and strengthens every aspect of the Commonwealth&rsquo;s system of serving people with intellectual and developmental disabilities in integrated settings, and it does so through a number of services and supports.&nbsp; The Department has a <a href="http://www.ada.gov/olmstead/">website</a>&nbsp;dedicated to <em>Olmstead </em>enforcement, which includes links to settlements, briefs, findings letters, and other materials.&nbsp;</p>

	MR. CARNEY: Hello, everyone. Welcome to the White House.</p>
<p>
	Before I take your questions I just wanted to note that today the Department of Health and Human Services announced that 12.8 million Americans will benefit from $1.1 billion in rebates from insurance companies. These rebates will be delivered by August 1st. The rebates were made possible by the Affordable Care Act, which generally requires insurance companies to spend at least 80 percent of consumers&#39; premium dollars on health care, not advertising, bonuses, or overhead. If insurance companies do not meet that standard, they must provide rebates to their consumers.</p>
<p>
	The rebates are just another example of how the Affordable Care Act is giving consumers a better value for their health care dollar and making our health care system stronger.</p>
<p>
	I&#39;m sure there will be a lot of questions about that, and perhaps on other issues.</p>
<p>

<p>
	Q Thanks, Jay. I wanted to ask about Fast and Furious and the move by the House panel to cite the Attorney General for contempt. Historically, in these standoffs, there&#39;s some arrangement reached between the White House and Congress to prevent a potential court fight that could hurt either side. Can you tell us if there&#39;s any such effort underway right now between the White House and Republicans on the Hill?</p>
<p>
	MR. CARNEY: I can tell you that we certainly would like to resolve this if there is a good-faith desire to resolve it on the part of House Republicans.</p>
<p>
	I think it&#39;s worth taking a step back. At the beginning of this year, Republicans announced that one of their chief legislative and strategic priorities was to investigate the administration and damage the President politically. We are nine days away from the expiration of federal transportation funding, which guarantees jobs for almost a million construction workers because Congress has not passed a transportation bill. We are 10 days away from student loan rates doubling, potentially impacting over 7.4 million borrowers. Yet, instead of creating jobs or helping the middle class, congressional Republicans are focused on this politically motivated, taxpayer-funded, election-year fishing expedition.</p>
<p>
	The problem of gunwalking was a field-driven tactic that dated back to the previous administration, and it was this administration&#39;s Attorney General who ended it. In fact, the Justice Department has spent the past 14 months accommodating congressional investigators, including producing 7,600 pages of documents and testifying at 11 congressional hearings. Yet, Republicans insist on moving forward with an effort that Republicans and objective legal experts have noted is purely political.</p>
<p>
	Given the economic challenges facing the country, we believe House Republicans should instead be engaged in efforts to create jobs and grow the economy, rather than political theater.</p>
<p>
	Q So you think it&#39;s political theater. But is there something happening behind the scenes? Do you think there is a good-faith effort that can be had here to resolve this?</p>
<p>
	MR. CARNEY: As you know, the Attorney General requested a meeting with the chairman of the committee and, while I would refer you to the Department of Justice for more details, made an effort to reach a resolution on this matter. And it is certainly in our -- we believe worth the effort of trying to find a solution. But we have to have a willingness on the other side to work with us to find that solution.</p>
<p>
	It is important for the public to know -- the public, by and large, is not particularly aware of this matter -- that every document related to the Fast and Furious operation has long since been provided to congressional investigators. And as I noted before, this is an operation and a tactic that was generated in the field during the previous administration that, when it was discovered by the Attorney General, when he became aware of it, he ended it in this administration. He referred it to the Inspector General for investigation. It has been recognized by the Attorney General and others in this administration, including the President, as a flawed tactic that needed to be ended and investigated, and this administration has done that.</p>
<p>
	What this is about, after all this time and all these documents and all the testimony, is an attempt to score political points. I think it&#39;s a -- speaking of flaws -- a flawed attempt, because it is this approach I think that explains at least in part why this Congress has the lowest public approval ratings of any in memory, if not history. So that is our view of the matter.</p>
<p>
	Q Last question. Can you clarify or elaborate on what you mean by every document has been provided when the President has asserted privilege on some documents?</p>
<p>
	MR. CARNEY: Correct. The issue here is about after-the-fact, internal documents that have to do with the executive branch&rsquo;s ability to operate appropriately and independently in response to congressional investigations and media inquiries. Everything that has been -- every piece of documentation that relates to the operation itself -- if the interest here is in the operation -- how it came about, its origination, how it was approved, why such a flawed tactic was employed, that has been provided to congressional investigators.</p>
<p>
	The assertion of privilege has to do with the protection of the executive branch&rsquo;s capacity, enshrined in the Constitution in the separation of powers, to deliberate independently and respond appropriately to congressional investigators&rsquo; requests and to media inquiries.</p>
<p>
	I would note also that, as I said, the Attorney General referred this manner, when he learned of it and put a stop to it, to the Inspector General. The Inspector General has access to all the documents at issue here, and is investigating at the Attorney General&rsquo;s request.</p>
<p>
	Reuters and then Jake.</p>
<p>
	Q Thanks, Jay. On the resignation of the Commerce Secretary, does the President plan to nominate somebody else and try and get them confirmed?</p>
<p>
	MR. CARNEY: Well, first, I would refer you to the President&rsquo;s statement thanking John Bryson for his service, noting Mr. Bryson&rsquo;s many decades of service both in the private sector and the public sector. And I would refer you to Secretary Bryson&rsquo;s letter explaining his resignation.</p>
<p>
	Dr. Blank, Becky Blank, will serve as Acting Commerce Secretary. If we have a personnel announcement to make beyond that we&rsquo;ll let you know. But the President has a lot of confidence in Dr. Blank -- she has served in this position already and did it quite well -- and has a great deal of confidence in her ability to carry on the important work that the Commerce Department does.</p>
<p>
	Q So that&rsquo;s a no, there&rsquo;s no plan to nominate someone else?</p>
<p>
	MR. CARNEY: No, I said that if we had a personnel announcement to make we would provide it, and we will, if and when we do.</p>
<p>
	Q Okay. Let&rsquo;s try on another thing. There&rsquo;s a story in the Times today about the CIA helping allies make sure that weapons don&rsquo;t get into the wrong hands in the Syrian opposition. I don&rsquo;t know that I can get you to talk about intelligence matters, but I wonder if you could talk about how much you know about the opposition and how much confidence anyone can have that weapons that go to the Syrian opposition stay out of the hands of potential foes?</p>
<p>
	MR. CARNEY: I appreciate what you noted because I&rsquo;m not going to discuss intelligence matters.</p>
<p>
	I can say that as a general matter -- and this is something I&#39;ve noted before -- that part of this period of helping the opposition consolidate itself has been one where we have evaluated who makes up the opposition. And we&#39;ve certainly noted that there are some elements of the opposition that are not necessarily friendly to the United States. They do not make up the bulk of the opposition, and the opposition is not entirely unified, as you know. But again, that would be a separate matter from the issue that you raised at the top of the question.</p>
<p>
	Q So how much confidence do you have that you know enough about the opposition that you can actually direct the flow of weapons in the right direction?</p>
<p>
	MR. CARNEY: Well, again, I&#39;m not commenting on an article so I can&#39;t -- I can only say to you that our position on providing lethal assistance has not changed.</p>
<p>
	What I can tell you is that we provide humanitarian aid to the Syrian people. We provide non-lethal assistance to the opposition, and we continue to work with the opposition, in concert with our international partners, to help them organize themselves, to help them develop greater capacities, all as part of the process of preparing for a political transition that the Syrian people absolutely desire and deserve and that will take place.</p>
<p>
	Q And that stops short of giving the opposition weapons?</p>
<p>
	MR. CARNEY: Again, we do not, as a matter of policy, provide lethal aid to the opposition.</p>
<p>
	Jake.</p>
<p>
	Q The documents being blocked through executive privilege, are any of them to or from individuals in the White House? Or are they all internal DOJ documents?</p>
<p>
	MR. CARNEY: I don&rsquo;t have a way to characterize the documents in question here. I can tell you that long ago, the administration provided documentation about specific questions regarding officials at the White House and the national security staff. That was a long time ago, which speaks to -- it was last fall -- speaks to how prolonged this political investigation has been ongoing.</p>
<p>
	The point I made earlier is that this is an assertion based on the absolute need for this President, as the steward of the executive branch -- not just for his administration but for every administration going forward -- to retain the separation of powers, to protect the capacity of the executive branch to deliberate on these matters, and to work independently and appropriately in response to these kinds of inquiries.</p>
<p>
	The issue here has been the operation known as Fast and Furious, and that operation is being thoroughly investigated by the Inspector General, who has access to all these documents, including the ones that you&rsquo;re asking about. And when it comes to the operation itself, everything has been provided to congressional investigators. And that is really the issue, isn&rsquo;t it? It is, how did this operation come about? And it originated in a field office during the previous administration. It was ended under this administration, by this Attorney General.</p>
<p>
	Q The operation began in fall 2009. The operation Fast and Furious began --</p>
<p>
	MR. CARNEY: The tactic began in the previous administration.</p>
<p>
	Q Okay, but the operation -- you keep saying --</p>
<p>
	MR. CARNEY: Okay. The tactic began in the previous administration, and it was ended under this one when this Attorney General discovered it and believed it was a flawed tactic. He then referred it to the Inspector General.</p>
<p>
	Q The documents that the President is asserting executive privilege and not disclosing -- you don&rsquo;t know or you&rsquo;re not going to say whether any of them are to or from anybody in the White House?</p>
<p>
	MR. CARNEY: Again, I&rsquo;m not going to characterize documents related to this except to say that, on the specific matter of White House -- anybody in the White House -- and this refers, I think -- and you know if you cover this, and I know some folks here have -- you know because these documents were provided and are out there and were provided back in the fall -- they relate to anybody in the White House knowing about the so-called Fast and Furious operation. Any document related to the White House, anybody at the White House knowing about the Fast and Furious operation was provided -- at the time was provided back in the fall.</p>
<p>
	Q In early 2011, the Justice Department wrote a letter to Congress in which they said something that was not true.</p>
<p>
	MR. CARNEY: Right.</p>
<p>
	Q Right? They said that ATF had nothing to do with guns going over into Mexico. That wasn&rsquo;t true, and it took them until December 2011 to take that back. Is there not a legitimate investigative and oversight responsibility to find out what the Department of Justice knew when they were giving false information to Congress?</p>
<p>
	MR. CARNEY: First of all, I think that matter has been thoroughly discussed in congressional testimony, including nine appearances by the Attorney General, including the 7,600 --</p>
<p>
	Q -- after the false statement?</p>
<p>
	MR. CARNEY: -- documents that have been provided. The issue -- I would refer you to a leading member of Congress in the Republican Party who, himself, called this politics. I think most people in this room understand that this is about politics. It is not about an effort to divine the truth in a serious matter -- which is why the tactic used in this operation was used, how it originated, and the consequences of using it.</p>
<p>
	This administration takes very seriously, the Attorney General, as demonstrated by the actions he took, takes it very seriously. And he has demonstrated his willingness to try to reach a resolution to this matter with congressional investigators. To this point, the interest of House Republicans has been to use this politically, as they previewed for the world in the beginning of this year when they made clear that that was one of their chief goals of the year.</p>
<p>
	Q Jay, just one last question. The family of Brian Terry, the slain Border Patrol agent at whose murder scene at least two of these guns were found, they disagree with your characterization about these investigations. They say that the Attorney General&rsquo;s refusal to fully disclose the documents associated with Fast and Furious and President Obama&rsquo;s assertion of executive privilege serves to compound this tragedy. It denies the Terry family and the American people the truth. That&rsquo;s a statement from the Terry family lawyer.</p>
<p>
	MR. CARNEY: Look, we absolutely agree with the need to find out the truth about why Fast and Furious happened, why the tactic that, again, was employed in the previous administration in different operations and was stopped by this Attorney General -- why it came about. And that&rsquo;s why the Attorney General referred it to the Inspector General. That is why we have provided Congress every document that pertains to the operation itself that is at issue here when you talk about the family that you referred to. And --</p>
<p>
	Q The Terry family.</p>
<p>
	MR. CARNEY: The Terry family. And that is separate from an attempt by members of Congress, Republican members of Congress, to try to score political points -- as Senator Grassley referred to his desire for a &ldquo;political scalp&rdquo; -- that is separate from trying to find out the truth about what happened in this operation, which this administration has been pursuing since the Attorney General discovered it.</p>
<p>
	Let me move around a little bit. Steve, and then Norah. Yes.</p>
<p>
	Q Can you say categorically that there is no -- there&rsquo;s been no cover-up?</p>
<p>
	MR. CARNEY: Absolutely.</p>
<p>
	Q There&rsquo;s nothing being covered up by the Justice Department, by the White House, as far as your involvement in --</p>
<p>
	MR. CARNEY: Again, the Attorney General --</p>
<p>
	Q -- not in the initial thing, but in the --</p>
<p>
	MR. CARNEY: The Attorney General referred this matter to the Inspector General. The Inspector General has full access to all documents we are discussing right now -- full access. And he is investigating this matter. Congress has been provided an enormous number of documents -- 7,600 pages. It has been provided access to the Attorney General on eight occasions, as well as other Justice Department officials and relevant officials to this matter. And this has gone on for months and months and months.</p>
<p>
	The assertion of privilege has to do with the absolute necessity of retaining the executive branch&rsquo;s independence enshrined in the Constitution in the separation of powers, to allow it to appropriately and independently respond to -- deliberate and respond to these kinds of inquiries. That is an assertion that has been made by administrations of both parties dating back 30 years. And that is the matter -- that is what the issue is here.</p>
<p>
	Again, the Attorney General of this administration ended this practice. He referred it to the Inspector General. The Inspector General has been investigating since that time, and has access to all these documents.</p>
<p>
	Yes, Norah.</p>
<p>
	Q On Syria, is the United States, along with allies, willing to give President Bashar al-Assad safe passage out of the country?</p>
<p>
	MR. CARNEY: It is not for us to decide that. It is up to the Syrian people to decide the fate of Mr. Assad. And it is -- I know the report you&rsquo;re referring to, and I would simply state that it is our position to work with the international community, to work with our partners to try to bring about the political transition that the Syrian people desperately deserve. And it is our firm belief that that political transition cannot take place without Bashar al-Assad stepping down, removing himself from power.</p>
<p>
	Q So what are you suggesting happens to Assad when he removes himself from power?</p>
<p>
	MR. CARNEY: Well, this is not a matter for the United States to decide, certainly not alone. The fact of the matter is we need to --</p>
<p>
	Q So when Assad steps down he can stay in Syria?</p>
<p>
	MR. CARNEY: President Assad has not made any indication -- I think he&#39;s made every indication to the contrary -- that he is going to participate in this political transition that his people are demanding. Instead he has launched a brutal assault against his own people, an assault that continues to this day.</p>
<p>
	Q But the U.S. policy position is to call for a peaceful political transition. Is there no answer with what to do with Assad once he steps down?</p>
<p>
	MR. CARNEY: Again, that is not something that the United States decides. That was an issue, I think you&#39;ll recall, that was raised during the Libya situation. The United States does not make a decision about the disposition of leaders who remove themselves from power. That&rsquo;s obviously up to the Syrian people.</p>
<p>
	Q But perhaps Yemen is a better comparison. Is the U.S. encouraging Kofi Annan to host sort of a conference-type, where there would be a transition of power like they did in Yemen and President Saleh got immunity? Is that a potential option?</p>
<p>
	MR. CARNEY: I&#39;m not going to negotiate from here an outcome in Syria except to say that our clear position is that Assad has no place in Syria&#39;s future. He has long since relinquished any claim he had to a spot in Syria&#39;s future as its leader by the horrific actions he&#39;s taken in an effort to thwart the will of the Syrian people and to retain his own hold on power.</p>
<p>
	Q And then final question on Syria. After the bilat between President Obama and President Putin, there seemed to be some indication afterwards from U.S. officials and others that Putin expressed that he was not wedded to Assad. Is that correct?</p>
<p>
	MR. CARNEY: I&#39;m not going to speak for President Putin. I can only tell you that, as the President said and others said, that Syria was certainly a topic of discussion during their lengthy bilateral meeting and the two leaders share the desire for an end to the violence in Syria. And I would refer you to the statements that each leader made. But I can&#39;t speak for President Putin from here.</p>
<p>
	Ed.</p>
<p>
	Q Since we were talking about transparency on Fast and Furious, a quick one on Bryson, Secretary Bryson stepping down. He&#39;s now -- you&#39;ve added an event with the President and Secretary Bryson. Why is that not open to the entire media and to television cameras? We haven&#39;t seen him since the hit-and-run incidents. Maybe people want to ask a question. Maybe we want to see how healthy he is. Why is it not open to cameras?</p>
<p>
	MR. CARNEY: Secretary Bryson submitted his resignation letter; the President accepted it. It is a matter -- in terms of his medical condition, I would simply refer you to his letter of resignation and refer you then to him and to the Commerce Department for further questions about that. This is a situation where --</p>
<p>
	Q Well, we&#39;d like to --</p>
<p>
	MR. CARNEY: -- the President is meeting with Secretary Bryson to thank him for his service, to thank him for the months he spent as Commerce Secretary and to commend him for his lifetime of service in the public and private sector.</p>
<p>
	Q You repeatedly, on Fast and Furious, kept saying that the Attorney General deserved credit for ending the gunrunning operation, but you seem to be leaving out the fact that Agent Terry was killed, and not --</p>
<p>
	MR. CARNEY: Not at all, Ed. That&#39;s an insult.</p>
<p>
	Q No, but you&rsquo;re not mentioning -- does he not deserve -- the Attorney General -- you&rsquo;re giving him credit for ending the operation. Does he not deserve some blame for the fact that this gunrunning operation resulted in a federal agent being killed on his watch?</p>
<p>
	MR. CARNEY: Well, the Attorney General made clear and has made clear on numerous occasions, including the eight times he has testified on Capitol Hill with regard to this matter, that when he learned about it, took this matter exceptionally seriously. That is why he ended it, and that is why he referred it to the Inspector General for investigation.</p>
<p>
	This is a tactic that was employed in operations in the prior administration -- during the prior administration. It was a field-driven tactic. It was not something that was generated out of Washington. When it was discovered by the Attorney General he put an end to it, and he launched -- or requested an investigation into it. I think that demonstrates the seriousness with which he regards it.</p>
<p>
	Q You&#39;ve also given the Attorney General credit here in this briefing for turning over -- I think you at one point said every page to Congress -- 7,600 pages. But my understanding is the Inspector General at the Justice Department has gotten tens of thousands of pages. I think the number is something 70,000 -- 80,000 pages. So how can you say every page has been turned over if Congress has gotten about 10 percent of it?</p>
<p>
	MR. CARNEY: Well, I think you&rsquo;re engaging in a little selective listening.</p>
<p>
	Q Well, you said every page --</p>
<p>
	MR. CARNEY: What I did say is every page related to the Fast and Furious operation. And that is what is at issue here -- how did this operation come about, how did this tactic begin to be used -- a flawed tactic, which everyone recognizes -- including the Attorney General, the President of the United States, congressional leaders of both parties was a flawed tactic and a mistake. And that&rsquo;s why this Attorney General referred this matter to the IG for investigation.</p>
<p>
	What is being -- the documents over which privilege is being asserted are internal executive branch documents that have to do with response to congressional inquiries, response to media inquiries. Those kinds of deliberations have been protected under privilege as a matter of the separation of powers enshrined in the Constitution by administrations of both parties dating back 30 years.</p>
<p>
	Q How many pages is the --</p>
<p>
	MR. CARNEY: I don&rsquo;t have a page count for you, Ed.</p>
<p>
	Q Well, why not?</p>
<p>
	MR. CARNEY: I just don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>
	Q I mean, you have given us no information about what is covered by what the President is claiming executive privilege on beyond the broad protecting advisors advice --</p>
<p>
	MR. CARNEY: As you, I think perhaps more than others, given the interest in this at your network, knows the administration, principally the Department of Justice, has cooperated extensively with congressional investigators, provided extensive documentation. The administration has even provided documents related to an interest in whether or not people in the White House knew of this operation at the time --</p>
<p>
	Q But why is there not a piece of paper --</p>
<p>
	MR. CARNEY: -- and provided that --</p>
<p>
	Q How many pages --</p>
<p>
	MR. CARNEY: -- let me finish, please, Ed -- and provided that last fall. And there wasn&rsquo;t a lot of interest in it because it disappointed those who were trying to make politics out of this.</p>
<p>
	And here is the central fact of this matter: This many months into it, this many months where House Republican leaders have been focused on this rather than helping the economy grow or helping it create jobs, is that there is no evidence of anything beyond what the Attorney General has said about this matter. And our level of cooperation has been extensive.</p>
<p>
	Q But when you say, &ldquo;go back to last fall,&rdquo; the President&rsquo;s executive privilege claim only came in yesterday. So why are we getting no information --</p>
<p>
	MR. CARNEY: Because we made every --</p>
<p>
	Q -- and how broad is the scope? I mean, what does it cover?</p>
<p>
	MR. CARNEY: Ed, I can attempt to get more details for you, in terms of what it covers. I don&#39;t have page numbers for you. What I can tell you is that the assertion of privilege came at the time when it became clear that there was no intention to resolve this matter, at least to that point, in a good-faith effort by House Republican leaders; that they were committed to their previously publicly announced intention to hold a contempt vote -- a highly political gesture, a completely partisan vote; and when efforts to resolve this matter otherwise were exhausted, in order to provide the absolutely necessary stewardship to the executive branch that this President must provide on behalf of his administration and every future administration, this action was taken.</p>
<p>
	Q Jay, on this question of how far the privilege goes, traditionally, privileges involve either the interactions with the White House and the White House staff, or national security. In this case, it seems to go beyond that. Is it a general thought in the White House that executive privilege -- is it applied to all the executive branch, even in the --<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	MR. CARNEY: Well, Steve, I&rsquo;m not the counsel, but I think that you need to do a little research. The truth is our assertion is consistent with the positions taken by prior administrations in disputes with Congress that date back to the Washington administration in 1792. The legal analysis is blessed by the career DOJ staff, who have advised both Democratic and Republican administrations on congressional executive relations. And as both historical practice and judicial decisions confirm, the fact that documents reside within an agency rather than in the White House is irrelevant to whether they are privileged.</p>
<p>
	There are at least five examples we can provide to you from recent history where that is demonstrated.</p>
<p>
	Chris and then Dan.</p>
<p>
	Q Jay, in 2007 President Obama criticized former President Bush for asserting executive privilege, for not handing over documents related to the firings of the nine U.S. attorneys. Does he not run the risk of looking hypocritical by criticizing the former President and now essentially evoking the same action?</p>
<p>
	MR. CARNEY: No, because this President, again, is -- after making, through his Department of Justice, an extraordinary effort to cooperate with Congress on this matter of providing thousands of pages of documents, having the Attorney General testify eight times -- asserting a privilege that retains the capacity of the executive branch now and in the future to operate independently, as enshrined in the Constitution.</p>
<p>
	I would note that this is the first time President Obama has asserted the privilege. But as you know, previous Presidents of both parties have done so repeatedly. According to CRS, executive privilege has been asserted 24 times since 1981. President George W. Bush asserted it six times. President Clinton, 14 times. President George H.W. Bush asserted it once. And President Reagan, three times. In fact, President Obama has gone longer without asserting the privilege than any President in the last three decades, which is consistent with the statement that you quoted.<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	Bottom line is, after a level of cooperation that I think demonstrates this administration&rsquo;s absolute interest in finding out the truth about the Fast and Furious operation, and why that flawed tactic was used, its origins and its implementation, its efforts to work with Congress to provide it the information that was required under legitimate oversight needs, an assertion was made -- because this has become a political fishing expedition.</p>
<p>
	And it is absolute evidence -- and I would refer you to the statements by congressional House -- rather, Republican congressional leaders from the beginning of the year, where they made clear that one of their chief priorities for this year was to use their investigative power in the House to score political points in this election year. I think knowing that tells you everything about the motivations here.</p>
<p>
	Q You make the point that you&rsquo;ve turned over thousands of documents, and yet not all of the documents that Congress would like to see. So what&#39;s the difference? Why not --</p>
<p>
	MR. CARNEY: Well, I think I made clear in answers several times to the questions that every document that relates to the Fast and Furious operation has been provided. And others have been provided, as I mentioned last fall, that relate to any knowledge anybody in the White House had contemporaneously about the Fast and Furious operation -- again, as part of an effort to cooperate, as part of an effort to resolve this matter in a professional way, not in a partisan way.</p>
<p>
	Unfortunately, there has been a clear commitment by the chairman involved and leaders in the Republican Party in the House but also in the Senate to try to turn this into a political issue.</p>
<p>
	And I think it is worth checking in with the American people as to whether they think that is worth the effort -- that that is what they what Congress to be doing at a time when Congress could be passing bills tomorrow that would keep a million construction workers on the job in this country in this economy. They could be passing bills tomorrow that would ensure that teachers would not be laid off, and that teachers that have been laid off would return to the classroom. They could pass a bill tomorrow to provide access to historically low mortgage interest rates to Americans across the country, during a period where we&rsquo;re still very much recovering from a terrible housing -- having the housing bubble burst and a crisis that ensued for so many families with regards to the values of their homes.</p>
<p>
	These are actions that the American people expect Congress to take. They do not expect Congress to waste time on politically motivated fishing expeditions, which this has clearly become.</p>
<p>
	Q And on that point, the President is going to hold an event later today to call on Congress to pass a bill that would keep student loan rates low. Leaders in the House and Senate in the Republican Party say that they haven&rsquo;t heard from the President or from anyone in the administration in recent days in response to a letter that they sent.</p>
<p>
	MR. CARNEY: Well, that&#39;s simply not true.</p>
<p>
	Q It&rsquo;s not true?</p>
<p>
	MR. CARNEY: It&rsquo;s simply not true. I can&rsquo;t speak to any communications the President has had -- as you know, he was participating in the G20 summit. But we are actively working with members of Congress to get this done.</p>
<p>
	Q In both parties?<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	MR. CARNEY: Absolutely in both parties. And the fact of the matter is the only reason why we&rsquo;re having this discussion is because President Obama raised it, brought it to the public&rsquo;s attention, went around the country talking about it. You would not be hearing about the absolute necessity of ensuring that these loan rates didn&rsquo;t double if it weren&rsquo;t for President Obama&rsquo;s decision to highlight this need. And in the end, we&#39;re going to get this done, I believe, because that&rsquo;s the action that he took. And we are actively working with members of Congress to get this done.</p>
<p>
	I would -- we&#39;ve seen this pattern before: Refusal to act; refusal even to acknowledge there&#39;s a problem unless and until the President highlights it, goes around the country talking about how it matters, how -- contrary to the assertions of some in the Republican Party -- education is very much an economic issue, how -- contrary to the assertion of the Speaker of the House -- this is not a &quot;phony&quot; issue, it is a deadly serious issue for more than 7 million students in America. And that&rsquo;s why we have to take action on it, and that&rsquo;s why in the end we believe that we can get there and get it done.</p>
<p>
	Q Well, have you gotten closer to determining what a pay-for would look like?</p>
<p>
	MR. CARNEY: I think that -- I will not negotiate from here the particulars, but the answer is, yes, broadly speaking. Because as you saw, which, again, is part of the pattern, when there was a recognition by Republicans that this had to be done because the public insisted on it, there was a kind of slightly angry effort to have a scalp thrown in by having non-germane, irrelevant pay-fors attached to it. But now we&#39;re getting to a point where we can hopefully reach an agreement that everybody can sign on to that will ensure that in just a few days these loan rates won&#39;t double for 7.4 million or 7.3 million American students.</p>

<p>
	Q During her press conference this morning, Nancy Pelosi suggested that Republicans were going after the Attorney General because he has been fighting voter suppression in various states. And in fact, as she wrapped up her press conference, she again reiterated that point. Does the White House share that view?</p>
<p>
	MR. CARNEY: I can&#39;t get into -- or I cannot divine the motivations behind what I think I&#39;ve clearly suggested is something we believe has become a fishing expedition that&rsquo;s unnecessary and unworthy of Congress at this time, when they could be acting on things that the American people care about, that could help the economy grow, help put teachers back to work and keep construction workers on the job. I didn&rsquo;t see the press conference that you&#39;re referring to.</p>
<p>
	What I do believe, and what we do believe, is that Republican leaders have, and Republican members of Congress have, through the actions that they&#39;ve taken with regards to this matter, lived up to their announcement at the beginning of the year that one of their chief legislative and strategic priorities would be to investigate the administration and damage the President politically. If you don&rsquo;t believe me, I refer you to them. They said it. And they&rsquo;re acting on their own agenda, which is unfortunate for the American people.</p>
<p>
	Q Earlier you said that you would like to see this resolved. As part of that resolution, do you see a point where the White House, the administration would be willing to hand over these documents in question, perhaps, with some conditions?</p>
<p>
	MR. CARNEY: I&rsquo;m not going to negotiate from here how that would work. I&rsquo;m not the appropriate person to do that either in here or with members of Congress. I would simply say that we have made every effort to resolve this matter, to cooperate with Congress, to provide the response -- adequate response to the legitimate oversight interest of Congress.</p>
<p>
	We believe very strongly that there is an absolutely appropriate role for legitimate congressional oversight, and that&rsquo;s why we have cooperated as extensively as we have with this investigation and others. It may be why -- as I pointed out in response to another question, given the history of assertions of privilege of this kind in the last 30 years, this President is asserting it for the first time at the latest point of any history in those -- at the latest point in his term of any President in those past 30 years.</p>
<p>
	But there is a point beyond which it is his responsibility, as steward of the executive branch, to the American people and to future Presidents and future administrations, to retain the constitutionally enshrined separation of powers, to retain the capacity of the executive branch to deliberate and consult internally so that it can appropriately and independently respond to inquiries like this.</p>
<p>
	Q On the Bryson case, is the White House conducting any kind of inquiry into those accidents, or this just a police investigation?</p>
<p>
	MR. CARNEY: The White House is not. And again, I would simply note that on this day that Secretary Bryson has submitted his resignation and the President has accepted it, that our interest is very much in thanking Mr. Bryson for his service both in this administration and his service both in the private and the public sectors over the many years, and to wish him well.</p>
<p>
	Q Jay, you said to an earlier question that there was no White House cover-up involved in these documents that the President had declared privilege on. And you also said that, just again, that the President is just trying to protect the constitutionally enshrined power of the executive power to make decisions independently. In the documents in question is there any information that if put on the public record would jeopardize national security interest or embarrass the White House?</p>
<p>
	MR. CARNEY: Well, those are -- (laughter) -- I&rsquo;m not going to give you a readout of documents that are under question here and relate to the assertion of privilege. What I can tell you is that there is nothing in these documents that pertains to the Fast and Furious operation. And I would simply note and have you ponder the fact that the Attorney General referred this to the Inspector General for investigation, and the Inspector General has access to all documentation as a member of the executive branch.</p>
<p>
	Q I guess the question is are you declaring it mostly on principle to ensure the separation of power or is there an issue of national security --</p>
<p>
	MR. CARNEY: Thank you for phrasing that. This is entirely about principle. It has nothing to do -- (laughter) -- no, no, this has nothing to do -- we have been absolutely clear about the fact that this operation used a tactic that originated in a field office that was flawed, that was wrong, and that had terrible consequences for the Terry family, and should not have been employed. And this Attorney General, when he learned about it, put an end to it and referred it for investigation.</p>
<p>
	I think that is -- long before this became an issue for House Republicans to politicize, this was something that the Attorney General made sure was being investigated by the Inspector General.</p>
<p>
	In terms of the assertion of privilege, it is, as I&rsquo;ve said I think on a number of occasions already today, absolutely about the principle. It is not something that the President takes lightly. He does it because it is his responsibility as steward of the executive branch to retain the capacity of this administration, and every administration going forward, to function appropriately and independently from the congressional branch of government.</p>
<p>
	And I think, again, in answer to Ed&#39;s question about why is he doing it just now: Because we have been working so hard to cooperate and reach agreement with congressional investigators as they pursued their legitimate oversight into the Fast and Furious operation. But as they made clear in their own statements, that&#39;s not what seems to be the motivating factor here.</p>
<p>
	Yes, Jared.</p>
<p>
	Q Is there a search underway for a permanent replacement for Bryson, and who will head that?</p>
<p>
	MR. CARNEY: I don&#39;t have any personnel announcements to make. And if I do have one, I&#39;ll be sure to let you know. Dr. Blank has been Acting Commerce Secretary in the past. She did an excellent job. The President has full confidence in her ability to serve in that capacity again. Today, we are thanking John Bryson for his service.</p>
<p>
	Q And then, a follow up.</p>
<p>
	MR. CARNEY: Yes.</p>
<p>
	Q For the last couple of days, Senator Marco Rubio has expressed frustration that he wasn&#39;t consulted before the President made his immigration policy announcement. Why not, considering he said he was working on something along the same lines?</p>
<p>
	MR. CARNEY: Well, Congress has had the ability to act on this ever since Republicans blocked the DREAM Act, even though it had a majority vote in the Senate. And what the President made clear in his statement in the Rose Garden on Friday is that this is a temporary solution, this is not a permanent solution. Congress needs to act so that we have a permanent solution.</p>
<p>
	And to your point, this is an announcement, first of all, made by Secretary Napolitano. It has to do with building on an enforcement decision about prosecutorial discretion and this is about implementing our enforcement priorities.</p>
<p>
	It is not about -- it has been reported as an executive order. Let&#39;s just be clear, it is not an executive order. This is an announcement made by Secretary Napolitano that is about the enforcement of our priorities, which as I think we&#39;ve made clear and demonstrated by the numbers, we believe should be focused on those who are criminals and those who are dangerous.</p>
<p>
	And that is what this new development that the President discussed in the Rose Garden, that Secretary Napolitano announced, is aimed at, which is ensuring that we are enforcing the law in a way that makes the right decisions in terms of priorities, and does not unfairly and unnecessarily punish people who come to this country through no fault of their own, often as infants or young children, who consider themselves American and are American in most ways, who contribute to this society and could be staffing our labs and attending our colleges -- and that&rsquo;s what this is focused on.</p>
<p>
	Q But isn&#39;t it a way to build support in reaching out to a senator who clearly has a lot of --</p>
<p>
	MR. CARNEY: Look, the President has made clear all along that he is very interested in a legislative solution to this situation.</p>
<p>
	Q Why not reach out to Senator Rubio on it?</p>
<p>
	MR. CARNEY: Well, we have, broadly speaking, reached out to members of Congress. Look, we have a situation here where the nominee of the Republican Party, the head of that party at this point, has said he would veto the DREAM Act. That is not encouraging as a sign of cooperation or willingness by Republicans, unfortunately, to --</p>
<p>
	Q Senator Rubio --</p>
<p>
	MR. CARNEY: Well, Senator Rubio is one Republican.</p>
<p>
	Q He&#39;s not Mitt Romney.</p>
<p>
	MR. CARNEY: And what we learned when this was voted on at the end of 2010 is that Republican opposition put an end to the majority support for passage of the DREAM Act. Now, if there is a change of view, this President would welcome that, and hopes that Congress will act -- because the announcement made Friday is not by any means a permanent fix to this problem.</p>
<p>
	Olivier.</p>
<p>
	Q Jay, we&#39;ve heard Republicans calling for Attorney General Holder to step down or be fired in the last couple days. Has anything happened in the last 48 hours that has dampened either the President&#39;s friendship with or confidence in the Attorney General?</p>
<p>
	MR. CARNEY: Absolutely not. I would refer you to my comments about partisan fishing expeditions and political theater, and one of the causes and consequences of the Congress with the lowest recorded approval ratings in history.</p>
<p>
	Q Would you favor us with a new statement of confidence in the Attorney General then?</p>
<p>
	MR. CARNEY: The President has full confidence in the Attorney General.</p>
<p>
	Q How far will the President go in standing by Eric Holder in the midst of all this --</p>
<p>
	MR. CARNEY: I&#39;m not sure what that means. The President has full confidence --</p>
<p>
	Q Will the President come out making a statement? Will the President talk to congressional leaders, particularly Republican leaders to try to --</p>
<p>
	MR. CARNEY: We are engaged with -- we have been and will continue to be engaged in an effort to resolve this, and await a demonstration of an interest to resolve this in a way that isn&#39;t all about political theater.</p>
<p>
	Q So should we be able to -- would we assume that the President will --</p>
<p>
	MR. CARNEY: I have no announcements to make about the President&#39;s schedule.</p>
<p>
	Yes.</p>
<p>
	Q Jay, were your comments a couple of minutes ago about Romney&#39;s threat to veto the DREAM Act if he were elected, is that something that would preview what the President&#39;s going to be saying tomorrow in Orlando?</p>
<p>
	MR. CARNEY: No, it&#39;s a statement of fact that I think I&#39;ve uttered before.</p>
<p>
	Q So what is the message?</p>
<p>
	MR. CARNEY: Well, I don&rsquo;t have a preview for the President&#39;s remarks. I simply -- in regard to questions about why there was not congressional action on the DREAM Act, I pointed you to a vote that took place where 55 United States senators voted yes, and the vast majority of Republicans blocked passage of it through the filibuster. So that&rsquo;s a fact.</p>
<p>
	And the President would gladly engage with Congress if there was a demonstration of a sincere interest by Republicans to act on the DREAM Act because, as he made clear on Friday, the enforcement decisions that were made by the Secretary of DHS did not represent in any way a permanent solution to this problem.</p>
<p>
	Sorry. So much interest today. Ari.</p>
<p>
	Q Thanks. Setting aside the most recent enforcement action on immigration, this morning Senator Rubio said in the year and a half he&#39;s been in the Senate, he&#39;s not had one conversation with anyone in this administration about immigration. So if the White House is serious about --</p>
<p>
	MR. CARNEY: Well, I&#39;m not aware that the Senator -- I&#39;m not aware that the Senator has called expressing interest.</p>
<p>
	Q He&#39;s made a lot of public statements expressing interest.</p>
<p>
	MR. CARNEY: The fact is that there was a vote on the DREAM Act and it failed, despite receiving a substantial majority, and it failed because of overwhelming Republican opposition. If there&#39;s a change in that disposition, the President is very happy to engage with Congress to achieve the kind of legislative solution that is absolutely required.</p>
<p>
	The fact is that that&rsquo;s what is needed here to ensure that these kids are not unfairly punished for the actions of their parents. These kids who are American in every way except for their papers should not be punished. And the actions that were taken by Secretary Napolitano and announced on Friday, and that the President spoke about in the Rose Garden, temporarily alleviate the problem, but they do not fix it. And that is for Congress to take up.</p>
<p>
	And we&#39;re certainly -- the President welcomes any expression of interest in resolving this matter by legislators of either party and welcomes the expression that you&#39;re referring to. But I have yet to see a bill emerge from the Republican side, in the Senate or the House, that addresses this program. I haven&#39;t even seen legislation submitted that addresses this problem. And if there&#39;s a sincere effort to do that, I&#39;m sure -- I can guarantee you the President will be happy to see it.</p>
<p>
	I&#39;ll take one more.</p>
<p>
	Q The GOP leaders in the House and Senate are insisting that you guys have not reached out to them on the student loan issue, responding to their May 31st letter. So if you&#39;re not talking to them, who are you talking to?</p>
<p>
	MR. CARNEY: I don&#39;t know which -- a response to a public letter that -- was that where they called it a phony issue, or where they called it not an economic issue?</p>
<p>
	We are engaged with Congress in trying to get this done. I don&#39;t have a roster of which members or which staffers. We are certainly engaged with Congress. I don&#39;t have a roster of with whom, but it obviously requires both parties to get this done. And, therefore, we are working with Congress, broadly speaking, to get it done.</p>
<p>
	And the only reason -- let&#39;s just remember -- the only reason why we&#39;re talking about this is because the President made it an issue. It wasn&#39;t in the Republican budget. Rates would have doubled. Rates would double under the Republican budget&#39;s proposals. The President thinks that is a terrible thing to do to students right now, and that&#39;s why he made it an issue. And it&#39;s only because the President sort of raised the volume on this that there is now pressure on Republicans in Congress to do the right thing and take action, so that 7 million-plus American students don&#39;t see their interest rates double.</p>
<p>
	Q So you&#39;re talking to Republicans who are not in leadership then?</p>
<p>
	MR. CARNEY: I&#39;m not sure the purpose of the question. I don&#39;t have in front of me a list of contacts.</p>
<p>
	Q Why can&#39;t you tell names, though, so we could just call them and say, are you guys in talks?</p>
<p>
	MR. CARNEY: Because is this like -- because you guys are interested in the gotcha -- oh, well, he is not talking to this person. I&#39;m saying --</p>
<p>
	Q Because they&#39;re saying that they&#39;re trying to reach out to you, and you&#39;re saying we&#39;re talking to them and you can&#39;t name --</p>
<p>
	MR. CARNEY: I can guarantee you that this is being worked at by this administration with Congress. I just don&#39;t have names for you, Ed. I&#39;m sorry.</p>
<p>
	Q But is it committee chairmen, or --</p>
<p>
	MR. CARNEY: Here&#39;s what&#39;s going to happen. When it gets resolved, and I think it will, it will not be a miraculous conception. It will be the result of negotiations between this administration and Congress -- broadly speaking, Congress. That includes Democrats and Republicans.</p>
<p>
	Q We&#39;re being told by McConnell&#39;s and Boehner&#39;s office specifically that it&#39;s not true. I mean, specifically.</p>
<p>
	MR. CARNEY: What I can tell you is that there are consultations going on in Congress that involve the administration to get this done. I don&#39;t have, again -- they know -- I don&#39;t have specific names for you to provide. It is irrelevant whether or not I have a roster of names. What I can tell you is it&#39;s being worked on by this administration and it&#39;s, we hope, going to get done, again because they know it has to get done because the American people are demanding that it get done, because it is entirely unfair to not take action to ensure that these loan rates don&#39;t double.</p>
<p>
	And as I said to Ed, if it does happen and we get this done in time to prevent the doubling of the rates, it won&#39;t be an accident. It will be the result of conversations, discussions and negotiations that involve the administration and Congress.</p>
<p>
	Thanks.</p>

	East Room</p>
<p>
	1:36 P.M. EDT</p>
<p>
	THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Thank you, everybody.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Everybody have a seat.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Well, it is good to see all of you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	AUDIENCE MEMBER:&nbsp; We love you!</p>
<p>
	THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; I love you guys back.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; I have to say, the -- I don&rsquo;t know about the choice of music coming in here, though.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; I love my Marine Band, but this is kind of a young demographic for the piano cocktail hour.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	So some of the most fun I&#39;ve had as President is when I get a chance to talk with you, college students, about the importance of earning a higher education in today&#39;s economy.&nbsp; And I&#39;ll admit that the East Room isn&#39;t as rowdy as Carmichael Arena at UNC, or -- we got any UNC folks here in the house?&nbsp; There we go.&nbsp; Coors Center at CU Boulder -- any -- no?&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; I have to say that most of you are much more dressed up than usually when I see you in your own natural habitats.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	But our message today is serious.&nbsp; Right now, the unemployment rate for Americans with a college degree or more is about half the national average.&nbsp; They earn twice as much as those who don&rsquo;t have a high school diploma.&nbsp; So whether it&#39;s at a four-year college, or a community college, or a technical program, some form of higher education, something beyond high school has never been more important.&nbsp; It&#39;s the surest path to finding a good job, earning a good salary, making it into the middle class.</p>
<p>
	And at the same time, over the last two decades, the cost of college has doubled -- it&#39;s actually more than doubled.&nbsp; And that means -- and I don&rsquo;t have to tell you, because you&#39;re probably tallying it up right now -- the cost for you to take out loans has increased, and you are more likely to rack up more debt.&nbsp; The average student who borrows to pay for college now graduates with about $26,000 of debt from their student loans.&nbsp; Americans as a whole now owe more on student loans than they do on their credit cards.&nbsp; And that is wrong, because we cannot afford to price the middle class and folks who aspire to go into the middle class, we can&#39;t price them out of the college education market.&nbsp; We can&#39;t stand by when millions of young people are already saddled with debt just as you&#39;re starting off.</p>
<p>
	Your parents, your grandparents, oftentimes they were in a position where when they got that first job, the first thing they&#39;re thinking about is, how do I save to buy a home and start a family.&nbsp; And if you&#39;re already dealing with a big bunch of debt before you even get started, that&rsquo;s a problem.&nbsp; And it&#39;s mind-boggling that we&#39;ve had this stalemate in Washington that threatens to make the situation even worse.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	So the reason you&#39;re all here, the reason all these fine-looking young people behind me are here is that in just over a week the interest rates on federal student loans are scheduled to double.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been talking about this now for what -- a month and a half, two months, three months, five months -- I&rsquo;ve lost track. (Laughter.)&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve been talking about it for a long time.&nbsp; If Congress does not get this done in a week, the average student with federal student loans will rack up an additional $1,000 in debt over the coming year.&nbsp; If Congress fails to act, more than 7 million students will suddenly be hit with the equivalent of a $1,000 tax hike.&nbsp; And that&rsquo;s not something that you can afford right now.</p>
<p>
	Now, as I said, if this warning sounds familiar, we&rsquo;ve been talking about this for months.&nbsp; Congress has had the time to fix this for months.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s part of the reason why everybody here looks impatient.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; This issue didn&rsquo;t come out of nowhere; it&rsquo;s been looming for months.&nbsp; But we&rsquo;ve been stuck watching Congress play chicken with another deadline.&nbsp; So we&rsquo;re&nbsp; nine days away from thousands of American workers having to walk off their job because Congress hasn&rsquo;t passed a transportation bill.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re 10 days away from nearly 7.5 million students seeing their loan rates double because Congress hasn&rsquo;t acted.&nbsp; This should be a no-brainer.&nbsp; It should not be difficult.&nbsp; It should&rsquo;ve gotten done weeks ago.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Now, the good news is there are folks in Congress trying to do the right thing.&nbsp; Last month, Democrats in the Senate put forward a plan that would have kept these rates in place without adding a dime to the deficit.&nbsp; Unfortunately, Senate Republicans got together and blocked it.&nbsp; Over in the House, the Republicans said they&rsquo;d keep these rates down only if we agreed to cut things like preventive health care for women, which obviously wouldn&rsquo;t fix the problem, but would create a new problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	This is -- even as they were voting in lockstep for an economic plan that would cut financial aid for nine million college students by an average of $1,000 and give a $150,000 tax cut to wealthy Americans.&nbsp; So I recognize that there&rsquo;s been some effort to change the subject from this rate hike.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	One Congressman warned that this is all about giving college students &ldquo;free college education&rdquo; -- which doesn&rsquo;t make much sense, because the definition of a loan is it&rsquo;s not free -- (laughter) -- you have to pay it back.&nbsp; Others have said we&rsquo;re just talking about student loans to distract from the economy.&nbsp; That doesn&rsquo;t make much sense because this is the economy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	This is all about the economy.&nbsp; This is all about whether or not we are going to have the best-trained, best-educated workforce in the world.&nbsp; That improves our economy.&nbsp; And higher education cannot be a luxury reserved just for a privileged few. It&rsquo;s an economic necessity for every family, and every family should be able to afford it.</p>
<p>
	So you guys, during this period when you&rsquo;ve been in college have been some of the toughest economic times since the 1930s,&nbsp; and there are still a lot of challenges ahead globally.&nbsp; And we can&rsquo;t control every economic headwind that we face, but this is something we can control.&nbsp; This is something we can do something about.&nbsp; Stopping student rates from doubling at the end of the month is something we can do right now to make a difference in the lives of all the American people.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	There&rsquo;s still 10 days for Congress to do the right thing.&nbsp; I understand that members of both parties say they want to get this done, and there are conversations taking place, but they haven&rsquo;t done it yet.&nbsp; And we&rsquo;ve got to keep the pressure on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	That&rsquo;s where all of you come in.&nbsp; Over the past few months, there are so many students and parents who have been working hard to shine a light on this issue.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve rallied on campuses, in your communities.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve called, you&rsquo;ve emailed, you&rsquo;ve tweeted your representatives in Washington.&nbsp; So you&rsquo;ve played your part in making sure your voice is heard and your democracy is responsive.</p>
<p>
	My main message is, as you guys embark on this day of action, I want to make sure you keep this going.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t stop until it&rsquo;s actually done.&nbsp; There is nothing more powerful than millions of voices that are calling for change, and all of your voices can make a difference.&nbsp; So keep telling Congress to do what&rsquo;s right, to get this done.&nbsp; Tell them now is not the time to double interest rates on your student loans.&nbsp; Tell them to double down on an investment in a strong and secure middle class -- and that means your education.&nbsp; Tell them now is the time to double down on an America where everybody who works hard has a fair shot at success.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	And for those who are not here and are watching, if you tweet, use the hashtag #dontdoublemyrate -- (laughter) -- #dontdoublemyrate.&nbsp; But I tell you, when I look out at this group right here, you give me confidence in America.&nbsp; You make me optimistic, not only because you&rsquo;re getting a great education, but also because all of you are participating and making sure that this democracy works the way it&rsquo;s supposed to.&nbsp; We need outstanding engineers, and we need outstanding nonprofit leaders, and we need outstanding entrepreneurs, but we also need outstanding citizens.&nbsp; And that&rsquo;s what you guys are displaying by your presence and your activities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	So, keep it up.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s get this done.&nbsp; Thanks, everybody.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>

	Today, Vice President Biden, Senior Advisor Valerie Jarrett and White House Advisor on Violence Against Women Lynn Rosenthal hosted an event to launch a new Public Service Announcement (PSA) about dating violence as part of the Vice President&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/1is2many">1 is 2 Many</a> campaign. Due to the fact that young women today ages 16 to 24 experience the highest rates of violence at the hands of someone they know, the PSA&rsquo;s target audience is men of this same age group. The PSA, which was produced by the White House, features professional athletes and other male role models who deliver the message that dating violence is unacceptable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Joining the President and Vice President in the PSA, which will air this summer on the ESPN Networks, the Fox Sports Networks, MLB Network, and NFL Network, are Joe Torre, Major League Baseball Executive Vice President, Baseball Operations, and Manager of four World Series championship teams, David Beckham of the LA Galaxy, Eli Manning of the New York Giants, Jeremy Lin of the New York Knicks, Evan Longoria of the Tampa Bay Rays, Jimmy Rollins of the Philadelphia Phillies, and ESPN correspondent Andy Katz.</p>
<p>
	Joining the Vice President and other Senior Administration officials today for the rollout of the PSA were Jimmy Rollins, David Price of the Tampa Bay Rays, who was there on behalf of his teammate Evan Longoria, and Andy Katz.</p>

	As Secretary, John fought tirelessly for our nation&rsquo;s businesses and workers, helping to bolster our exports and promote American manufacturing and products at home and abroad.&nbsp; John has proven himself an effective and distinguished leader throughout his career in both the public and private sectors, from his success in the business world to his work leading on issues in the renewable energy industry.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am grateful that he brought that invaluable experience and expertise to my administration, and am pleased that he has agreed to continue supporting our efforts to strengthen the economy and create good jobs by serving as a member of my Export Council going forward.<br />

	MRS.

	&nbsp;<br />
	Before I get started, on behalf of Barack and myself, I just wanted to say that -- and I said this earlier -- that our hearts and our prayers are going out to all of the families affected by the fires here in this state and in other states throughout the west.&nbsp; And I want to give a special thanks to all of the brave firefighters and first responders -- (applause) -- who, not just in this situation but in every situation, they put themselves in harm&rsquo;s way to make sure that our lives and our communities are safe.&nbsp; So we are so grateful for their heroic efforts.&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	And we&rsquo;re also proud of how communities here in this state are coming together as you continue to support each other to respond, and begin to do the hard work of recovering.&nbsp; I just want you to know that you have a country that is standing behind you every step of the way, so -- (applause.)<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	And with that, I want to thank Carla for that very kind introduction.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s give her another round of applause.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	And I want to thank a few more people as well.&nbsp; I want to thank our National Campaign Co-Chairs:&nbsp; Secretary Federico Pe&ntilde;a, who&rsquo;s a dear, dear friend of ours -- (applause) -- State Senator Giron, who is here, I know, with her husband; she&rsquo;s been amazing -- City Councilwoman -- City Councilman Leroy Garcia -- (applause) -- Pastor Kimal James, who is here as well -- (applause) -- and Democratic Party Chair Rick Palacio, who has just been amazing every step of the way.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; And I just got to meet the Regional Field Director here, Eva Siepersad, who -- she&rsquo;s been doing phenomenal work, so I got to meet her.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; And to all the Pueblo County Commissioners, all the City Councilmembers who have taken time out to be here today, thank you all.&nbsp; Thank you for your service.&nbsp; Thank you to your families.&nbsp; We are just so grateful.&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	And finally, I want to thank all of you -- (applause) -- yes! -- our extraordinary volunteers and organizers, our team leaders.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Thank you for everything you do, day in and day out, to make this campaign possible.&nbsp; We could not do what we do with you.&nbsp; And you should know that all of the hard work that you do -- that tough work knocking on people&rsquo;s doors that you don&rsquo;t know, right?&nbsp; That&rsquo;s not always easy.&nbsp; The work that you do registering voters, making calls, giving people here in this area the information they need about the issues they care about.<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	And you have to know that that kind of grassroots work that you all are doing to get people focused and fired up -&ndash; that is the work that is at the core of this campaign.&nbsp; It makes all the difference.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s how we did it four years ago, and that&rsquo;s how we&rsquo;re going to do it again today -- with your help.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; So, thank you.&nbsp; Thank you so much.&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	And one thing I&rsquo;ve learned, being married to my husband, is that the work you all are doing, it&rsquo;s not easy.&nbsp; And I know that so many of you are putting in such long hours, and I know you&rsquo;re doing it even though you all have busy lives of your own -- you have your own families to take care of; you&rsquo;ve got your jobs to do; many young people are still getting their education, which we want you to continue to do.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	But I also know that there&rsquo;s a reason why all of us are here today doing this kind of work.&nbsp; And it&rsquo;s not just because we all support an outstanding President, my husband.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; I&rsquo;m a little biased.&nbsp; I might just be a little biased.&nbsp; There may be other biased people in the room, but I think our President is awesome.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; And we&rsquo;re not just doing this because we want to win an election -- which we do, and we will.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; What I like to remind folks around the country -- and I even remind myself -- we&rsquo;re doing this because of the values we believe in.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s really it.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re doing this because of the vision for this country that we all share.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t care who we are, we believe and want so much of the same things.&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	We&rsquo;re doing this because we want all of our children to be able to go to good schools, you know?&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; You know those schools -- the kind of schools that inspire them; the kind of schools that push them to be their best and prepare them for the jobs and careers of the future.&nbsp; We want that for all of our kids.&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	We want our parents and our grandparents to be able to retire with dignity, because after a lifetime of hard work, these folks in our lives should be able to enjoy their golden years, don&rsquo;t you agree?&nbsp; (Applause.)<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	We&rsquo;re doing this because we want to restore that basic middle-class security for our families, because we believe that in America folks shouldn&rsquo;t go bankrupt because they get sick.&nbsp; Not here.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; People shouldn&rsquo;t lose their homes because someone loses a job.&nbsp; We believe that responsibility should be rewarded and hard work should pay off.&nbsp; We believe that everyone should do their fair share, but they should play by the same rules.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	And the truth is, these are basic American values, right?&nbsp; This isn&rsquo;t new.&nbsp; These are the values that so many of us were raised with, including myself.&nbsp; And I tell my story; I&rsquo;m proud of my background.&nbsp; You all know my father was a blue-collar city worker.&nbsp; He worked at the city water plant his entire life.&nbsp; And he supported our family -- we lived in a little-bitty apartment on the South Side of Chicago.&nbsp; South Side!&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; And growing up, I saw firsthand how my parents saved and sacrificed.&nbsp; I was talking to Eva about this, about my dad, because her dad was the same kind of person.&nbsp; How my parents poured everything they had into me and my brother because they wanted us to have the kind of education they could only dream of.&nbsp; Education was everything in my family -- everything.&nbsp; It was our ticket to the middle class.&nbsp; It was our path to the American Dream.&nbsp; It was a chance for us to have opportunities our parents never had -- the chance to get a college degree; the chance to own a home; the chance to provide an even better life for our own families, right?&nbsp; (Applause.)<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	So to make this happen for us, my parents worked hard.&nbsp; My mom spent hours volunteering in our neighborhood public school.&nbsp; And she made us finish every bit of homework, every night.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; That was important in our household.&nbsp; And when we finally went off to college, pretty much all of my college tuition came from student loans and grants.&nbsp; I know there are people here in this room who know what that feels like, right?&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; But for my brother and I, our dad still paid a small portion of that tuition himself, and every semester my dad was determined to pay that portion of his bill, his share, and to pay it right on time.&nbsp; He was so proud to be sending his kids to college, and he couldn&rsquo;t bear the thought of me or my brother missing that registration deadline because his check was late.<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	And really, more than anything else, that is what&rsquo;s at stake in this election.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re fighting for.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s that fundamental promise that no matter who you are or how you started out, if you work hard, you can build a decent life for yourself and an even better life for your kids.&nbsp; That is the American Dream.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; That is the American Dream that we&rsquo;re all working for.<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	And from now until November, we&rsquo;re going to need all of you to get out there and tell everyone -- tell everyone you know about how Barack is on our side, fighting for the values we believe in and the vision we all share.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	And I want you to start by reminding people how Barack is fighting every day for working families, starting with tax cuts so folks can keep more of their income for things like gas and groceries and school clothes for their kids.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; You can tell people how he cut taxes for small businesses 18 times -- 18 times.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Because your President knows that rebuilding our economy, it starts with folks who are running the restaurants and the shops and the startups that create jobs that put people back to work.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	But also remind people, though, and Carla mentioned this, about how, back when Barack first took office, this economy was losing an average of 750,000 jobs every single month.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what he inherited.&nbsp; And people need to understand that.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what he walked into.&nbsp; But also let them know that for the past 27 straight months, we have actually been gaining private sector jobs -&ndash; a total of more than 4 million jobs in just two years.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	So while we know we still have a long way to go to rebuild our economy, today, millions of people are collecting a paycheck again; millions of people like my dad are able to take care of their bills again.<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	But you can also tell people about health reform, because we passed health reform, and as a result -- (applause) -- yes, indeed, together we passed health reform.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; And because of that reform, the people we love will no longer have to skip important health screenings because they can&rsquo;t afford them.&nbsp; Not in America.&nbsp; Instead, insurance companies will have to cover preventative care, basic things like contraception, cancer screenings, prenatal care, and cover them at no extra cost.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what health reform has done.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; But people have to know.&nbsp; They have to understand what this all means.<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	Because of this reform, millions of our senior citizens have saved an average of more than $600 a year on their prescription drugs -- yes, because of health reform.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; And for all of the parents out there with college-aged kids, because of reform, children who are -- can stay on their parents&rsquo; insurance until they&rsquo;re 26 years old.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; And as parents, I know you know how much that means.&nbsp; That is how 3.1 million more young people in our country are getting the health care they need.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	But I also want you to tell people about all that this President is doing for health care [sic].&nbsp; Tell people how Barack has invested in Head Start, and he&rsquo;s raised standards in our public schools, and helped more than -- to be able to -- helped more of our young people be able to afford college.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the work he&rsquo;s been doing.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	And I want you to tell them -- understand why he&rsquo;s doing it.&nbsp; Because Barack knows -- both of us know what it&rsquo;s like to be drowning in student debt.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Because back when we first started out, our combined student loan bill was actually higher than our mortgage.&nbsp; How many people can relate to that?&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; So that is why he has doubled Pell Grants, helping 4 million more students attend college.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; And Barack has a vision for education in this country:&nbsp; By the end of this decade, he wants more Americans to hold a college degree than any other country in the world.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s his plan.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	But you can also tell people how Barack has been fighting for the DREAM Act, because he believes that -- (applause) -- your President believes that it is time to stop denying responsible young people opportunities in this country just because they&rsquo;re the children of undocumented immigrants.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; And I&#39;m sure, as you all know, last week this administration announced new measures to lift the shadow of deportation from many of these young people who came here as children and were raised as Americans.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	But while this step is an important one, it is not a permanent solution.&nbsp; So Barack is going to keep on fighting to get Congress to give these young people a real pathway to citizenship.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what your President is working on.<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	I want you to remind people also that Barack kept his promise and he brought our troops home from Iraq.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Remind people about that.&nbsp; And he&rsquo;s working hard to give our veterans and military families the support and benefits they&rsquo;ve earned for the sacrifices they&rsquo;ve made.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	And as far as us ladies in the house -- (applause) -- our President has been working for us, too.&nbsp; Tell people that it is now easier for women to get equal pay for equal work because of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; That was the first bill Barack signed as President of the United States, the first thing he did was to look out for us.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	But it&#39;s also important to let people know why he signed this bill.&nbsp; He signed this bill because he knows that closing that pay gap for women can mean the difference between them losing $50, $100, $500 from every paycheck, or having that money to pay their bills and provide for their families.&nbsp; He did it because when so many women are now breadwinners for our families in this country, women&rsquo;s success in this economy is the key to families&rsquo; success in this economy.&nbsp; We know that.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	And I definitely don&rsquo;t want you to forget to tell people about those two brilliant Supreme Court Justices Barack appointed &ndash;- Justice Elena Kagan, Justice Sonia Sotomayor.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; And for the first time in history, our daughters and sons watched three women take their seats on our nation&rsquo;s highest court.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	Now, that is only the tip of the iceberg.&nbsp; I could go on, and on, and on.&nbsp; You all know it, everybody knows it.&nbsp; But what is important to understand is that all of this and so much more is at stake this November.&nbsp; It&#39;s all on the line.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	And in the end, it all boils down to one simple question:&nbsp; are we going to continue the change we&rsquo;ve begun and the progress we&rsquo;ve made?&nbsp; Or are we going to allow everything that we&rsquo;ve fought for to just slip away?&nbsp; No, we know what we need to do.&nbsp; We can&rsquo;t turn back now.&nbsp; We have to keep moving forward.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; We have to keep moving forward!&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	Four more years!<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	AUDIENCE:&nbsp; Four more years!<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	MRS. OBAMA:&nbsp; And more than anything else, that is what we&rsquo;re working for &ndash;- the chance to finish what we started, all the great work.&nbsp; The chance to keep fighting for the values we believe in and the vision we all share.<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	And that is what my husband has been doing every single day as President -- every single day.&nbsp; And let me tell you, over the past three-and-a-half years, I have had the privilege of seeing up close and personal what being President really looks like.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; And I have seen how the issues that come across a President&#39;s desk, they&#39;re always the hard ones -- they&#39;re the problems with no easy solutions, the judgment calls where the stakes are so high and there&#39;s no margin for error.<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	And as President, you can get all kinds of advice from all kinds of people, but at the end of the day, let me just tell you, when it comes time to make that decision, as President, all you have to guide you are your life experiences.&nbsp; All you have to guide you are your values and the vision that you have for this country.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s all that&rsquo;s there.<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	In the end, it all boils down to who you are and what you stand for, right?&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; And we all know who my husband is.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; We all know -- we all know -- what he stands for.&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	Barack Obama is the son of a single mother who struggled to put herself through school and pay the bills.&nbsp; Barack Obama is the grandson of a woman who woke up before dawn every day to catch a bus to her job at a bank.&nbsp; And even though Barack&rsquo;s grandmother worked hard and was good at her job, like so many women she hit that glass ceiling, and watched men no more qualified than she was be promoted up the ladder ahead of her.&nbsp; But she didn&rsquo;t complain -- that&rsquo;s what Barack saw.&nbsp; He watched her just keep getting up, just keep giving her best every single day to support her family.&nbsp; How many people do we know like that in our lives?&nbsp; (Applause.)<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	So, understand, your President knows what it means when a family struggles.&nbsp; He knows what it means to work hard because you want something better for your kids.&nbsp; And like so many -- like me, like so many of you, Barack knows the American Dream because he&rsquo;s lived it.&nbsp; It is his life.&nbsp; And he wants everyone who&rsquo;s willing to work hard to have that same opportunity -- everyone.&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	So when it comes time to stand up for our children and our workers and our families, you know what my husband is going to do.&nbsp; When there&rsquo;s a choice about protecting all of our rights and our freedoms, you know where Barack stands, don&rsquo;t you?&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; When we need a leader who will be on our side, fighting for us no matter what, you know you can count on my husband because that&rsquo;s what he&rsquo;s been doing every single day as President of the United States.&nbsp; And I am proud of him.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	But I have said this before, and I will say it again, and again: Barack can&#39;t do this alone.&nbsp; He needs all of you.&nbsp; He needs you to keep doing what you&#39;ve been doing -- working hard making those phone calls, knocking on those doors, registering as many voters as possible.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; That&rsquo;s right.<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	I want you to think about it this way -- I want you all here to multiply yourselves.&nbsp; Multiply yourselves.&nbsp; Reach out to everyone you know -- your friends, family, neighbors.&nbsp; Anyone who is not paying attention, make sure they&#39;re paying attention.&nbsp; You find them, you make sure that they know how to get involved in this campaign.&nbsp; Send them to barackobama.com -- it&#39;s an easy way to get started -- and tell them about giving just a little part of themselves each week to this campaign, and all the difference it&#39;s going to make in all of our lives.<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	Tell them that when it comes to the issues we care about &ndash;- whether our kids can get an education, whether our families will have health care, whether we will finally pass the DREAM Act &ndash;- (applause) -- I want you to tell them that if we stay home this November, we won&rsquo;t just stop moving forward, we&#39;re going to start moving backwards.&nbsp; We can&#39;t do that.<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	AUDIENCE:&nbsp; No!<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	MRS. OBAMA:&nbsp; So this is a make or break moment.&nbsp; It truly is.&nbsp; This is it.&nbsp; We&#39;re at a crossroads.&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	And as Barack has said, this election will be even closer than the last one -- that you can count on.&nbsp; And if you doubt for a minute the difference that you all will make in this election, I just want you to remember that in the end, this election could come down to those last few thousand people we get to the polls, those last few thousand people we get registered to vote.&nbsp; And when you think about those kind of numbers across an entire state -- just think for a minute as these numbers are spread out all over this state.&nbsp; Think about what that means.&nbsp; That could mean just registering one more person, right?<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	AUDIENCE MEMBER:&nbsp; Yes!<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	MRS. OBAMA:&nbsp; It could mean just getting one more person to the polls on Election Day.<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	So as you&#39;re out there working, just remember with every door you knock on, with every event you host, with every single conversation you have, think about it this way -- think, this could be the one that makes the difference.&nbsp; That is the kind of impact that each of us can have here.&nbsp; You got it?&nbsp; This could be the one.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; This could be the one.&nbsp; Think about that.&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	And I&rsquo;m not going to kid you, this journey is going to be long, and it is going to be hard, and there will be plenty of twists and turns along the way.&nbsp; That is the only guarantee I can give you.&nbsp; But we have to understand that that&rsquo;s how change always happens in this country.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s how real change happens.<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	But if we keep showing up, if we keep fighting the good fight, if we keep doing what we know is right and fighting for the values we believe in, then we always get there.&nbsp; We always do.&nbsp; We have never moved backwards, we&#39;ve always moved forward.<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	AUDIENCE:&nbsp; Forward!<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	MRS. OBAMA:&nbsp; Maybe not in our lifetimes, but maybe in our children&rsquo;s lifetimes.&nbsp; Maybe in our grandchildren&rsquo;s lifetimes.<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	Because in the end, that&rsquo;s what this is all about.&nbsp; It&#39;s about them.&nbsp; And that&rsquo;s what I think about every night when I put my girls to bed.&nbsp; I think about the world I want to leave for them, and for all our sons and daughters.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	I think about how I want to do for them what my Mom and Dad did for me.&nbsp; I want to leave them a foundation worthy of their dreams.&nbsp; I want to give them opportunities that matches their promise, because every single child in this country has promise.&nbsp; I want to give all our kids that sense of limitless possibility -- the belief that here in America, there&rsquo;s always something better if you&rsquo;re willing to work for it.&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	So Pueblo, we cannot turn back now.&nbsp; We have come so far, but we have so much more work to do.&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	So I have one last question:&nbsp; Are you in?<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	AUDIENCE:&nbsp; Yes!<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	MRS. OBAMA:&nbsp; No, no, no, are you really in?<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	AUDIENCE:&nbsp; Yes!<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	MRS. OBAMA:&nbsp; Are you ready to roll up your sleeves?&nbsp; Are you ready to have those conversations, share our vision, get people registered to vote, make sure they&#39;re at the polls, make sure that President Obama wins Colorado and wins the Presidency?&nbsp; Are you ready for that?<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	AUDIENCE:&nbsp; Yes!<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	MRS. OBAMA:&nbsp; Because I am so ready.&nbsp; I am so fired up.&nbsp; I can&#39;t wait to make this happen.<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	You all are amazing.&nbsp; Thank you so much.&nbsp; God bless you.<br />
	&nbsp;<br />

	On this World Refugee Day, the United States joins the international community in recognizing the nearly 15 million refugees worldwide, and millions more internally displaced people. We honor the dignity, courage, and determination of these men, women and children who have fled persecution and violence in their homelands and the commitment and generosity of the countries and organizations that provide them protection and assistance during this difficult time.</p>
<p>
	While we work to promote lasting peace and stability and human rights around the world, so that these refugees may one day return to their countries in safety and dignity, we know that for some voluntary return may not be possible. For these refugees social, economic, and legal integration in their country of asylum not only provides opportunities for them to begin rebuilding their lives, but also for the contribution of their knowledge, talents, and skills to be fully realized. Americans know the benefits of these valuable contributions firsthand.&nbsp; Since 1975, we have welcomed more than 3 million refugees from all over the world and continue to lead the world in refugee resettlement.</p>
<p>
	Together with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the international community, we are committed to protecting the world&rsquo;s refugees, mitigating their suffering, and working to help find ways for them to live in dignity and peace.</p>

	MRS. OBAMA:&nbsp; Wow!&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; You know, this feels like four more years, right?&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Thank you so much.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t tell you how proud and thrilled I am to be here today.<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	Before I get started, on behalf of myself and my husband, I just want to say that our hearts and our prayers are with all of the families affected by the fires here in this state and in other states out west.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	AUDIENCE MEMBER:&nbsp; Thank you!<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	MRS. OBAMA:&nbsp; And I also want to say a special thank-you to the brave firefighters and first responders -- (applause) -- those men and women who are putting themselves in harm&rsquo;s way every day to put flames out to protect our communities.&nbsp; We are so grateful for their heroic service.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s give them a round of applause.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
	And it&rsquo;s also wonderful to see how communities here are coming together to support each other as you continue to respond and begin the work of recovery.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a wonderful example, and I want you all to know that America stands behind you every step of the way.&nbsp; So I just wanted to say that.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	I also have to thank Stacy -- and Max -- for that wonderful introduction and for sharing that story.&nbsp; We are so glad that kids like Max can get the care that they need, because that&rsquo;s what we want for all of our kids.&nbsp; And there are a lot of beautiful little faces out here.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re doing this for you, yes.&nbsp; (Laughter and applause.)<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	And I also got a chance to see Susan Daggett, Maggie Fox -- hey, you guys!&nbsp; Thank you so much for being here, for having our backs, for joining us here today.<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	And I have to recognize -- although I haven&rsquo;t seen her yet -- your former First Lady and my dear friend, Jennie Ritter, who is here, somewhere out there.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; And your Deputy Mayor, Cary Kennedy, who is here as well.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; And I understand that Dana did some firing up out here.&nbsp; I want to thank here and Reverend Riley-Duval for her good words and her prayers.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; And to Suzy, who also got us fired up and ready to go, right?&nbsp; Did she do good?&nbsp; (Applause.)<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	But finally, I want to thank all of you, our extraordinary volunteers and organizers.&nbsp; You guys are doing it all, you&rsquo;re out here standing in the heat -- I love that.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; Thank you for everything that you do, day in and day out.&nbsp; I cannot say this enough:&nbsp; The work that you do makes this campaign possible.&nbsp; All the work that you&rsquo;re doing -- knocking on those doors, making those phone calls, registering those voters -- I just want you to know that doing what you&rsquo;re doing, giving folks the information they need, as Stacy says, about the issues we care about is critical.&nbsp; And this kind of grassroots work that you all are doing to get people focused and fired up -&ndash; that work is the core of this campaign.&nbsp; It means absolutely everything.&nbsp; And that&rsquo;s how we won not just this state but this presidency four years ago, and that&rsquo;s how we&rsquo;re going to do it again today.&nbsp; So, thank you.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	But one thing that I do know is that the work that you&rsquo;re doing is not easy.&nbsp; And I know that you&rsquo;re putting in a lot of long hours.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve seen you in action before.&nbsp; I know that you all have your own busy lives to lead -- you&rsquo;ve got your families to raise; you&rsquo;ve got school coursework -- I hope many of you are focused; you&rsquo;ve got jobs and careers you&rsquo;re trying to build.&nbsp; But I also know that there&rsquo;s a reason why all of us are in this school right now, today.<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	AUDIENCE MEMBER:&nbsp; Michelle, we love you!<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	MRS. OBAMA:&nbsp; I love you, too!&nbsp; (Applause.)<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	And we would not be standing here without you.&nbsp; We are here not just because we all support an extraordinary President -&ndash; because our President is awesome.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; And we&rsquo;re not just here because we want to win an election, which we do, and we will.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; We&rsquo;re all here because of the values we believe in.&nbsp; Truly, we&rsquo;re doing this because of the vision for this country that we all share.<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	We&rsquo;re doing this because we want all of our children -- all of them -- to have good schools -- the kind of schools that push them; the kind of schools that inspire them and prepare them for good jobs and wonderful opportunities.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	We want our parents and our grandparents to be able to retire with dignity -&ndash; (applause) -- because we believe that in America, after a lifetime of hard work, they should be able to enjoy their golden years.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	We want to restore that basic middle-class security for our families, because we believe that in America folks shouldn&rsquo;t go bankrupt because someone gets sick.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; We believe that folks shouldn&rsquo;t lose their home because someone loses a job.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; We also believe that responsibility should be rewarded, and hard work should pay off.&nbsp; We believe that everyone should do their fair share, but play by the same rules.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	And the thing that I tell people everywhere I go -- we have to remember, these are basic American values.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; This isn&rsquo;t new.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re the values that so many of us were raised with, including myself, which is why I share my story.&nbsp; You all know -- my father was a blue-collar city worker; he worked for the city water plant, and my family lived in a little-bitty apartment on the South Side of Chicago.&nbsp; South Side!&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; And like so many people, my parents never had the kinds of educational opportunities that my brother and I had.&nbsp; But one thing they had -- and I know this is going on in homes all across this country -- they did everything for us growing up.&nbsp; I saw how they saved, how they sacrificed, how they poured everything they had into me and my brother because they wanted us to have the kind of education and opportunities they could only dream of.<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	And while pretty much most of my college tuition came from student loans and grants -- yes, I know, a few people can feel that, right? -- (applause) -- my dad still paid a small portion of that tuition himself.&nbsp; And every semester, my dad was determined to pay that bill and to pay it on time.&nbsp; He was proud to be able to send his kids to college, and he couldn&rsquo;t bear the thought of me or my brother missing a registration deadline because his check was late.&nbsp; Like so many people in this country, my father took great pride in being able to earn a living that allowed him to handle his responsibilities; to take care of his family and to pay all of his bills and to pay them on time.<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	And more than anything else, that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s at stake in this election.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re working for.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re fighting for.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s that fundamental promise that no matter who you are or how you started out, if you work hard, you can build a decent life for yourself and an even better life for your kids.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; And what gives us all hope -- it is that promise that binds us together as Americans.&nbsp; That is what makes us who we are.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what makes this country great.<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	But from now until November, Barack is going to need all of you to get out there.&nbsp; As Stacy said, get out there and tell everybody you know about what this is about.&nbsp; Tell them about our values.&nbsp; Tell them about this vision that we all share, and about everything that&rsquo;s at stake in this election.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what we need you to do.<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	And you can start by telling them how Barack fought for tax cuts for working families and small businesses.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; And he did this because he knows that an economy built to last starts with middle-class folks, and companies who are creating jobs that are putting people back to work.&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	But remind them how, back when Barack first took office, people -- a lot of people forget this economy was losing an average of 750,000 jobs a month.&nbsp; A month!&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what he inherited.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what he walked in -- that&rsquo;s what welcomed him into the Oval Office.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; But also let them know that for the past 27 straight months, we have actually been gaining private sector jobs -&ndash; a total of more than 4 million jobs in just two years.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	So while we absolutely have a long way to go to rebuild this economy, it&rsquo;s important for people to understand that today, millions of people are collecting a paycheck again; millions of people like my dad are able to handle their business and pay their bills again.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	And Stacy talked about health reform, but also because we passed health reform -- health insurance -- people need to understand that insurance companies will have to cover preventative care, things like contraception and cancer screenings -- (applause) -- things like prenatal care, and they have to do it at no extra cost.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	Because of this reform, people have to understand that millions of our senior citizens have saved more -- on average more than $600 a year on their prescription drugs thanks to this reform.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	And for all of you who have kids graduating from college, because I know you&rsquo;re out there -- parents -- for all those parents, those kids can now stay on their parents&rsquo; insurance until they&rsquo;re 26 years old.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; And that is how 3.1 million of our young people are getting the health care they need today.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	But we can also talk about education, too.&nbsp; Let people know that Barack is working hard to raise standards in our public schools and make college more affordable for millions of young people.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; This President&rsquo;s vision is that by the end of this decade, more Americans will hold a college degree than any other country in the world.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s your President&rsquo;s vision for our children.<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	You can also tell people about how Barack has been fighting for the DREAM Act.&nbsp; And understand this -- (applause) -- because he believes that it is time to stop denying responsible young people opportunities in this country just because they&rsquo;re the children of undocumented immigrants.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; And just last week, this administration announced new measures to lift the shadow of deportation from many of these young people, who came here as children and were raised as Americans.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	But while this is an important step, it is not a permanent solution.&nbsp; So Barack is going to keep fighting to get Congress to give these young people a real pathway to citizen [sic].&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re working for.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	But you can also remind folks that your President kept his promise -- he brought our troops home from Iraq.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; And remind them how our brave men and women in uniform finally brought to justice the man behind the 9/11 attacks.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	And it&rsquo;s also important to know that because of this President, our troops will no longer have to lie about who they are to serve the country they love -&ndash; (applause) -- because Barack ended &ldquo;don&rsquo;t ask, don&rsquo;t tell.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Applause.)<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	And for all of our women out there -- (applause) -- it is so important to remind women in this country that it is now easier for us to get equal pay for equal work because of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; That was the very first bill Barack signed into law, the very first thing he did for us as President of the United States.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; But I want people to know why Barack signed this bill, why it was so important.&nbsp; Because he knows that closing that pay gap can mean the difference between women in this country losing $50, $100, $500 from each paycheck, or having that money in their pockets to buy gas and groceries, and put clothes on the backs of their children.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Barack did this because he understands that when so many women are now breadwinners for our families, women&rsquo;s success in this economy is the key to families&rsquo; success in this economy.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	And please, we cannot forget about those two brilliant Supreme Court Justices that Barack appointed -- (applause) -- and how, for the first time in history, our sons and daughters watched three women take their seat on our nation&rsquo;s highest court.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	I could go on and on and on.&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	AUDIENCE MEMBER:&nbsp; Please do!&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	MRS. OBAMA:&nbsp; See, but I don&rsquo;t anybody passing out.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; But what we all have to understand and we cannot take for granted -- all of this, all of this and so much more is at stake in November.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s all on the line.&nbsp; And in the end, it all boils down to one simple question:&nbsp; Will we continue the change we&rsquo;ve begun and the progress we&rsquo;ve made?&nbsp; Or are we going to let everything we&rsquo;ve worked so hard for just slip away?<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	AUDIENCE:&nbsp; No!<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	MRS. OBAMA:&nbsp; No.&nbsp; We know we cannot do that.&nbsp; We can&rsquo;t turn back now.&nbsp; We need to keep moving forward.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; We need to keep moving forward.&nbsp; And more than anything else, that&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re here.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re working for -- truly, the chance to finish what we started.&nbsp; The chance to keep fighting for those values we believe in, that vision that we all share.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t care who we are; the things I just talked about, every American in this country wants the same things.<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	But let me tell you, that is what my President and my husband has been doing every single day.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Every single day he&rsquo;s been fighting for us.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; I have watched him fight for us.&nbsp; And let me tell you, over the past three and a half years, as First Lady I have had the chance to see up close and personal what being President looks like.&nbsp; And let me just share something with you:&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve seen how the issues that come across a President&rsquo;s desk, they&rsquo;re always the hard ones.&nbsp; Always.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re the problems with no easy solution, because when there is one somebody else comes up with it.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; The judgment calls where the stakes are so high, and there&rsquo;s no margin for error.&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	And as President, you&rsquo;re going to get all kinds of advice and opinions from all sorts of people.&nbsp; But at the end of the day, when it comes time to make that decision, as President, all you have to guide you are your life experiences, are your values, is your vision for the country.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s all you have.&nbsp; It matters.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	In the end, it all boils down to who you are and what you stand for.&nbsp; And let me tell you, we all know who my husband is.&nbsp; We all know what he stands for, don&rsquo;t we?&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	See, your President, Barack Obama, he&#39;s the son of a single mother who struggled to put herself through school and pay the bills.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Barack Obama is the grandson of a woman who woke up before dawn every day to catch a bus to her job at the bank.&nbsp; And even though Barack&rsquo;s grandmother was -- worked hard to support his family and she was good at her work, like so many women, she hit that glass ceiling and men no more qualified than she was were promoted up the ladder ahead of her.&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	So what you have to understand about your President is that he knows what it means when a family struggles.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; He knows what it means when someone doesn&rsquo;t have a chance to fulfill their potential.&nbsp; And today, as a father, he knows what it means to want something better for your kids.&nbsp; Those are the experiences that have made him the man, and, yes, the outstanding President he is today.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	And that is why I&#39;m working so hard for him.&nbsp; Because when it comes time to stand up for American workers and American families, you know what Barack Obama is going to do.&nbsp; When there&rsquo;s a choice about protecting our rights and our freedoms, you know where Barack is going to stand -- he&#39;s going to stand with us.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; And when we need a leader to make the hard decisions to keep this country moving forward, you know you can count on my husband, because that is what he&rsquo;s been doing every single day as President of the United States.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	But I have said this before, and I will say it again, and again, and again:&nbsp; He cannot do this alone.&nbsp; That is not how a democracy works.&nbsp; Barack needs your help.&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	He needs you to keep doing what you&#39;re doing.&nbsp; Keep making those calls -- it matters.&nbsp; Keep knocking on those doors -- it matters.&nbsp; Keep registering those voters -- it absolutely matters.&nbsp; And when you look around this room, I want you to think about multiplying yourselves.&nbsp; Multiply yourselves.&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	Reach out to your friends and your family and your neighbors.&nbsp; Tell them how to get involved.&nbsp; Tell them how to go to barackobama.com to find out how they can get started.&nbsp; Because it&#39;s easy, right?&nbsp; We want them to just give a little part of themselves each week to this campaign, and we need you to make that happen.<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	Because as Barack has said, this election will be even closer than the last one.&nbsp; And if you have any doubt about the difference that you will make, understand this:&nbsp; This is all going to come down to those last few thousand people we register to vote.&nbsp; It will.&nbsp; It&#39;s going to come down to those last few thousand people we get to the polls in November.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	And just think for a minute, as you think about multiplying yourselves and you think about this work -- when you look at those kinds of numbers and they&#39;re spread across an entire state, it might mean registering just one more person.&nbsp; Just think -- just one more.&nbsp; It might mean just helping one more person in your community vote on Election Day.&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	So every call, I want you to think one more person.&nbsp; With every door you knock on, think this could be the one.&nbsp; With every conversation you have, this could be the one that makes the difference.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s how important you all are.&nbsp; Understand that.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; That is the kind of impact that each of you will have on this election.&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	And I&rsquo;m not going to kid you, this journey is going to be long.&nbsp; It is going to be hard -- you ready for hard?&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	AUDIENCE:&nbsp; Yes!<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	MRS. OBAMA:&nbsp; And there will be plenty of twists and turns along the way.&nbsp; But we have to remember that that&rsquo;s how change always happens in this country.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s how real change happens.&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	But if we keep showing up, if we keep fighting the good fight and doing what we know is right -- because we know -- then eventually we&rsquo;ll get there.&nbsp; We always do.&nbsp; Maybe not in our lifetimes, but maybe in our children&rsquo;s lifetimes.&nbsp; Maybe in our grandchildren&rsquo;s lifetimes.<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	Because what I tell myself is that in the end, that is what this is all about.&nbsp; It is not about us, it is about them.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; And that is what I think about every night when I tuck my girls in.&nbsp; I think about the world I want to leave for them, and for all of our sons and daughters.&nbsp; I think about how I want to do for them what my Dad did for me.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	I want to give them a real foundation for their dreams.&nbsp; I want to give them opportunities worthy of their promise.&nbsp; Because all of our kids are worthy -- all of them.&nbsp; (Applause.) I want to give them that sense of limitless possibility, right?&nbsp; That belief that here in America, there&rsquo;s always something better out there if you&rsquo;re willing to work for it.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	So if you want to know why I&#39;m passionate, it&#39;s because of them.&nbsp; So we cannot turn back now.&nbsp; No.&nbsp; We have come too far, but there is so much more work to do.&nbsp; There just is.&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	So let me ask you one question, one last question:&nbsp; Are you in?<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	AUDIENCE:&nbsp; Yes!&nbsp; (Applause.)<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	MRS. OBAMA:&nbsp; Come on, are you in?<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	AUDIENCE:&nbsp; Yes!&nbsp; (Applause.)<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	MRS. OBAMA:&nbsp; Are you ready to roll up your sleeves?<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	AUDIENCE:&nbsp; Yes!&nbsp; (Applause.)<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	MRS. OBAMA:&nbsp; Are you ready?&nbsp; Are you ready to work for our future?&nbsp; To work for that vision for our children?&nbsp; Because I am so fired up.&nbsp; Can you tell?<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	AUDIENCE:&nbsp; Yes!<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	MRS. OBAMA:&nbsp; I am so ready to go.&nbsp; Can you tell?&nbsp; We&#39;re going to need you every step of the way.<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	Thank you all.&nbsp; God bless.<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	END&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />

	On June 23, 1972, Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 was signed into law, requiring equal access to academic and athletic opportunities for all students, regardless of gender, in all of the education programs and activities of a school, university, or other entity receiving federal financial assistance. At a time when many universities barred the admission of women and when female sports teams were scarce, Title IX marked a momentous shift for women&rsquo;s equality in classrooms, on playing fields, and in communities throughout our nation. In the 40 years since that historic day, Title IX has promoted equal access for women at tens of thousands of elementary and secondary schools, colleges and universities, libraries, museums, vocational schools, and correctional facilities throughout the U.S., while prohibiting sex discrimination in employment at all such institutions.&nbsp; Today, every agency in the federal government that offers federal financial assistance is a guardian and guarantor of Title IX.</p>
<p>
	This commonsense rule has dramatically reshaped opportunities available to women across the country. For example, since Title IX was passed, the number of female college athletes has increased from 30,000 to 190,000, the number of female high school athletes has grown ten-fold, and the proportion of female professors in science and mathematics has more than doubled. A recent study concluded that an increase in female sports participation leads in later years to an increase in women&rsquo;s labor force participation down the road and greater female participation in previously male-dominated occupations, particularly in high-skill, high-wage fields.</p>
<p>
	Since coming into office, President Obama and his Administration have worked to advance Title IX compliance to ensure that all individuals enjoy the equality of opportunity that the law provides. The Administration continuously strives to provide guidance and support to state and local governments and educational institutions to bolster equal access to educational opportunities in a full range of academic subjects, including science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM); equal resources in athletic pursuits; and an academic environment free of sex-based discrimination, including sexual harassment and violence.&nbsp; With this celebration of 40 years of successes under Title IX, the President reaffirms his commitment to further advancing a new era of equal opportunity and gender equity for generations to come.</p>
<p>
	Today, the White House Council on Women and Girls is hosting an event to celebrate the opportunities that Title IX has afforded women and girls across America in the 40 years since its enactment. The event will be livestreamed on <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/live">www.whitehouse.gov/live</a> starting at 2 pm and the twitter hashtag is #WHtitleIX. The program features government officials and leaders in the field to discuss the past, present, and future of this landmark legislation. Government officials include: Valerie Jarrett, Senior Advisor to President Obama &amp; Chair of the Council on Women &amp; Girls, Tina Tchen, Executive Director of the Council on Women and Girls, Secretary of Education Arne Duncan and former Senator Birch Bayh, who co-authored the legislation. Highlights of the event include two panel discussions. The first features a conversation with Billie Jean King, WNBA President Laurel J. Richie and others on &quot;Intergenerational Views on the Impact of Title IX in Athletics&quot; moderated by Bonnie Bernstein, ESPN broadcaster and former All-American gymnast. Later, Benita Fitzgerald-Mosely, Olympian, U.S. Track &amp; Field, Engineer, and Chief of Sport Performance for USA Track &amp; Field will moderate a panel on &quot;Advancing Our Commitment to Title IX in Education&quot; which will include Astronaut Mae Jemison, Jared L. Cohon, President of Carnegie Mellon and Gabriela Farfan, a winner of Intel&#39;s Science Talent Search, among others. The audience is comprised of leaders from the education, athletic, and the women&rsquo;s rights communities as well as high school girls from the area.</p>
<p>
	<u><strong>At today&rsquo;s event, the White House will make the following announcements</strong></u>:</p>
<p>
	<strong>Federal Agencies will commit to developing common guidance to colleges and universities on responsibilities and best practices for Title IX compliance</strong>: Building on the success of previous interagency collaboration efforts on Title IX and STEM, the Department of Education will lead an initiative with the Department of Justice and science &amp; technology agencies (including the Department of Energy, NASA, National Science Foundation, and the Department of Health and Human Services) to develop common guidance for grant recipient institutions to comply with Title IX. These activities will consolidate agency expertise &ndash; which currently differs from agency to agency &ndash; to help institutions better understand their compliance obligations and ways to improve access and outreach to women and girls in STEM fields.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Department of Education will revise Title IX Technical Assistance to K-12 and post-secondary institutions to explicitly address STEM</strong>: The Department of Education will announce the revision of its Title IX Technical Assistance presentation, made available nationwide to state and local education agencies across the country, to include information on how institutions receiving federal financial assistance are also required to ensure equal access to educational programs and resources in STEM fields.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Department of Education will broaden data collection to provide new gender-based academic analyses</strong>: In 2011, the Department of Education released a first-of-its-kind national data tool for analyzing student participation, achievement, and educational experiences through the transformed Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC), a survey of the nation&#39;s public school districts and elementary and secondary schools that provides information on student enrollment, educational programs, and services disaggregated by race/ethnicity, sex, limited English proficiency status, and disability. With hundreds of data points collected through mandated school reporting, the publically-available CRDC database allows for powerful analyses of topics such as school discipline rates, retention by grade, and participation in advanced math and science courses broken down by gender. At the time of the Title IX anniversary, the Department has published a <a href="http://www.ed.gov/ocr/docs/gender-equity-in-education.pdf">new gender-based analysis of the CRDC data</a>, taking stock of the gender gaps across K-12 education. Moving forward, the Department of Education will expand the 2011-12 CRDC dataset from 85% of U.S. students to include 100% of all U.S. public school students nationwide, becoming a universal collection of data representing all schools.</p>
<p>
	<u><strong>Building on Title IX Success</strong></u></p>
<p>
	Since 2009, the Obama Administration has helped students and education workers understand their rights under Title IX and has worked with academic institutions to develop environments that encourage equal opportunities for all. Some of the Administration&rsquo;s accomplishments include:</p>
<p>
	<strong>Identifying promising practices for increasing access and opportunity for women in STEM</strong>: Though more women than men graduate from college with bachelor&rsquo;s degrees, women&rsquo;s participation in STEM fields is disproportionately low, especially in fields like engineering.&nbsp; To help further participation in STEM fields, in 2009 the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) produced a report entitled <em>Title IX &amp; STEM: Promising Practices for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics</em>. This document, and the subsequent 2012 NASA toolkit, <em>Title IX and STEM: A Guide for Conducting Self-Evaluations</em>, point to promising strategies identified by STEM departments across the country that hold great potential to increase women&rsquo;s access and participation in high-skill, high-demand STEM fields that drive American innovation.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Reinforcing Title IX&rsquo;s role in preventing sexual harassment and violence</strong>: According to the Center for Disease Control, nearly one in five college women will be the victim of a sexual assault.&nbsp; To combat this problem, in 2011, the Department of Education issued comprehensive guidance to help schools, colleges and universities better understand their obligations under federal civil rights laws to prevent and respond to incidents of sexual assault.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Removing barriers to women&rsquo;s academic achievement by ensuring Title IX compliance across federal agencies</strong>: Multiple federal agencies, including the Department of Education, the Department of Justice, the Department of Energy and NASA, are actively engaged in reviews and investigations to ensure that educational institutions are in compliance with Title IX. Their work includes offering feedback to institutions on how to improve policies that adversely affect women&rsquo;s participation in these fields. Since the beginning of the Administration, the Department of Education alone has received nearly 3,000 Title IX-related complaints&mdash;more than ever before in any previous three-year period&mdash;and launched more than 35 system-wide proactive investigations that collectively address a broad range of Title IX-related issues in institutions across the nation.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Integrating Title IX into broader women focused efforts</strong>: To address some of the career challenges that may inhibit women&rsquo;s pursuit of careers in STEM, the National Science Foundation (NSF) included Title IX compliance and assistance as part of its institution-wide <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/career-life-balance/">Career-Life Balance Initiative</a>, launched in September 2011. As a part of this effort, NSF has made Title IX and gender equity a priority in its on-site review process for large facilities.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Stepping Up Title IX Enforcement</strong>: Over the past three years, the Departments of Justice and Education have doubled-down on their efforts to enforce Title IX&rsquo;s requirements.&nbsp; The Departments are working vigorously to ensure safe and non-discriminatory school environments&mdash;and has secured significant victories along the way.&nbsp; For example, this past summer, the Department of Justice launched an investigation of a school district following a complaint of sex-based harassment that resulted in comprehensive reform of the district&rsquo;s sex-based harassment policies and practices. In addition the Department of Education has launched 11 proactive systemic investigations into issues of sexual violence and harassment. The Department of Justice has also helped advance gender equity in athletics.&nbsp; In 2009, when a state high school athletic association decided to make cuts to competition opportunities in a way that exempted nine times as many boys as girls from those cuts, the Department joined advocates representing female athletes by filing an amicus brief arguing that the decision violated Title IX and the Constitution.&nbsp; Within one day of receiving the brief, the association rescinded its decision, sparing both girls and boys from these cuts.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Ensuring Equal Opportunity in Athletics</strong>: Over the last three years, the Department of Education&rsquo;s Office for Civil Rights has initiated 17 proactive investigations of possible systemic Title IX violations in athletics programs and obtained more than 100 robust resolution agreements ensuring that female students have an equal opportunity to participate in sports across the country. It also released policy guidance reversing a shift made during the prior Administration and reinstating more meaningful requirements for how to assess whether schools and colleges are providing more equitable athletic opportunities to students of both genders as required by Title IX.&nbsp;</p>

	Convention Center<br />
	Los Cabos, Mexico</p>
<p>
	5:47 P.M. MDT</p>
<p>
	PRESIDENT OBAMA:&nbsp; I want to begin by thanking my good friend and partner, President Calderon, and the people of Los Cabos and Mexico for their outstanding hospitality and leadership.&nbsp; Mexico is the first Latin American country to host a G20 summit, and this has been another example of Mexico playing a larger role in world affairs, from the global economy to climate change to development.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Since this is my last visit to Mexico during President Calderon&rsquo;s time in office, I want to say how much I&rsquo;ve valued Felipe&rsquo;s friendship and the progress that we&rsquo;ve made together over the past several years.&nbsp; And building on the spirit here at Los Cabos, I&rsquo;m absolutely confident that the deep ties between our countries will only grow stronger in the years to come.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Now, over the past three years, these G20 summits have allowed our nations to pull the global economy back from a free fall and put us back on the path of recovery and growth.&nbsp; In the United States, our businesses have created jobs for 27 months in a row -- more than 4 million jobs in all -- and our highest priority continues to be putting people back to work even faster.<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	Today, we recognize that there are a wide range of threats to our ongoing global economic recovery and growth.&nbsp; But the one that&rsquo;s received the most focus obviously and that does have a significant impact on the United States as well as globally is the situation in Europe.&nbsp; As our largest trading partner, slower growth in Europe means slower growth in American jobs.&nbsp; So we have a profound interest in seeing Europe prosper.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve been consulting closely with my European counterparts during this crisis, as we&rsquo;ve done here at Los Cabos.</p>
<p>
	I do think it&rsquo;s important to note, however, that most leaders of the eurozone, the economies are not part of the G20.&nbsp; The challenges facing Europe will not be solved by the G20 or by the United States.&nbsp; The solutions will be debated and decided, appropriately, by the leaders and the people of Europe.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	So this has been an opportunity for us to hear from European leaders on the progress they&rsquo;re making and on their next steps -- especially in the wake of the election in Greece, and because they&rsquo;re heading into the EU summit later this month.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s also been a chance for the international community, including the United States -- the largest economy in the world, and with our own record of responding to financial crises -- to stress the importance of decisive action at this moment.</p>
<p>
	Now, markets around the world as well as governments have been asking if Europe is ready to do what is necessary to hold the eurozone together.&nbsp; Over the last two days European leaders here in Cabos have made it clear that they understand the stakes and they pledged to take the actions needed to address this crisis and restore confidence, stability, and growth.&nbsp; Let me just be a little more specific.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	First, our friends in Europe clearly grasp the seriousness of the situation and are moving forward with a heightened sense of urgency.&nbsp; I welcome the important steps that they have already taken to promote growth, financial stability and fiscal responsibility.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m very pleased that the European leaders here said that they will take all necessary measures to safeguard the integrity and stability of the eurozone, to improve the functioning of the financial markets.&nbsp; This will contribute to breaking the feedback loop between sovereigns and banks, and make sovereign borrowing costs sustainable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	I also welcome the adoption of the fiscal compact and it&rsquo;s ongoing implementation, assessed on a structural basis, together with a growth strategy which includes structural reforms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	G20 leaders all supported Europe working in partnership with the next Greek government to ensure that they remain on a path to reform and sustainability within the eurozone.&nbsp; Another positive step forward was the eurozone&rsquo;s commitment to work on a more integrated financial architecture -- including banking supervision, resolution, and recapitalization, as well as deposit insurance.&nbsp; Also, in the coming days Spain will lay out the details of its financial support request for its banks restructuring agency, providing clarity to reassure markets on the form and the amount and the structure of support to be approved at the earliest time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	It&rsquo;s also positive that the eurozone will pursue structural reforms to strengthen competitiveness in deficit countries, and to promote demand and growth in surplus countries to reduce imbalances within the euro area.</p>
<p>
	And finally, I welcome the fact that Europe is determined to move forward quickly on measures to support growth and investment including by completing the European single market and making better use of European funds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Of course, Europe is not, as I said, the only source of concern when it comes to global growth.&nbsp; The G20 also agreed that reversing the economic slowdown demands a renewed focus on growth and job creation.</p>
<p>
	As the world&rsquo;s largest economy, the best thing the United States can do is to create jobs and growth in the short term, even as we continue to put our fiscal house in order over the long term.&nbsp; And as part of that effort, we&rsquo;ve made significant progress in advancing our trade agenda.&nbsp; This is an essential to promoting growth, innovation and jobs in the United States.</p>
<p>
	Here in Los Cabos, we announced important steps towards closer integration with three of our major trading partners.&nbsp; Both Mexico and Canada have been invited to join the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations, which is an ambitious 21st century trade agreement that will now include 11 countries.&nbsp; And this agreement holds enormous opportunities to boost trade in one of the world&rsquo;s fastest growing regions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Even as we build this new framework for trade in the Asia Pacific, we&rsquo;re also working to expand our trade with Europe.&nbsp; So today, the United States and the European Union agreed to take the next step in our work towards the possible launching of negotiations on an agreement to strengthen our already very deep trade and investment partnership.</p>
<p>
	In addition, and in keeping with our commitments at the last G20 in Cannes, we agreed that countries should not intervene to hold their currencies at undervalued levels, and that countries with large surpluses and export-oriented economies needed to continue to boost demand.</p>
<p>
	So, in closing, I&rsquo;d note that with Mexico&rsquo;s leadership, we continue to make progress across a range of challenges that are vital to our shared prosperity -- from food security to Greek economic growth that combats climate change, from financial education and protection for consumers to combating corruption that stifles economic growth, and in strengthening financial regulation to creating a more level playing field.&nbsp; All of this happened in large part because of the leadership of President Calder&oacute;n.&nbsp; I want to thank him, and I want to thank my fellow leaders for their partnership as we work very hard to create jobs and opportunity that all of our citizens deserve.</p>
<p>
	So with that, I&rsquo;m going to start with Ben Feller of AP.</p>
<p>
	Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you very much, Mr. President.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re all hearing a lot of encouraging promises about what Europe plans to do, but can you assure us that those actions, if they&rsquo;re able to come together on them, will actually do anything to create jobs in America this year?&nbsp; And if Europe is not able to rally in a big way pretty quickly, do you think that will cost you the election?</p>
<p>
	THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Well, first of all, I think that what I&rsquo;ve heard from European leaders during the course of these discussions is they understand the stakes.&nbsp; They understand why it&rsquo;s important for them to take bold and decisive action.&nbsp; And I&rsquo;m confident that they can meet those tests.</p>
<p>
	Now, I always show great sympathy for my European friends because they don&rsquo;t have to deal with one Congress -- they have to deal with 17 parliaments, if you&rsquo;re talking about the eurozone.&nbsp; If you&rsquo;re talking about the European Union, you&rsquo;re talking about 27.&nbsp; And that means that sometimes, even after they&rsquo;ve conceived of approaches to deal with the crisis, they have to work through all the politics to get it done.&nbsp; And markets are a lot more impatient.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	And so what I&rsquo;ve encouraged them to do is to lay out a framework for where they want to go in increasing European integration, in resolving the financial pressures that are on sovereign countries.&nbsp; Even if they can&rsquo;t achieve all of it in one full swoop, I think if people have a sense of where they&rsquo;re going, that can provide confidence and break the fever.&nbsp; Because if you think about Europe, look, this remains one of the wealthiest, most productive regions of the world.&nbsp; Europe continues to have enormous strengths -- a very well-educated, productive workforce.&nbsp; They have some of the biggest, best-run companies in the world.&nbsp; They have trading relationships around the world.&nbsp; And all of these problems that they&rsquo;re facing right now are entirely solvable, but the markets, when they start seeing potential uncertainty, show a lot more risk aversion, and you can start getting into a negative cycle.</p>
<p>
	And what we have to do is it to create a positive cycle where people become more confident, the markets settle down, and they have the time and the space to execute the kinds of structural reforms that not only Europe, but all of us are having to go through, in balancing the need for growth, but also dealing with issues like debt and deficits.&nbsp; And I&rsquo;m confident that over the next several weeks, Europe will paint a picture of where we need to go, take some immediate steps that are required to give them that time and space.&nbsp; And based on the conversations that I&rsquo;ve had here today and the conversations that I&rsquo;ve had over the last several months, I&rsquo;m confident that they are very much committed to the European project.</p>
<p>
	Now, all this affects the United States.&nbsp; Europe as a whole is our largest trading partner.&nbsp; And if fewer folks are buying stuff in Paris or Berlin, that means that we&rsquo;re selling less stuff made in Pittsburgh or Cleveland.&nbsp; But I think there are a couple of things that we&rsquo;ve already done that help.&nbsp; The financial regulatory reforms that we passed means that our banks are better capitalized.&nbsp; It means that our supervision and our mechanisms for looking at trouble spots in our financial system are superior to what they were back in 2008.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s an important difference.&nbsp; But there&#39;s still some more things we can do.</p>
<p>
	And the most important thing we can do is something that I&rsquo;ve already talked about.&nbsp; If Congress would act on a jobs plan that independent economists say would put us on the path of creating an extra million jobs on top of the ones that have already been created -- putting teachers back in the classroom, putting construction workers back on the job rebuilding infrastructure that badly needs to be rebuilt -- all those things can make a significant difference.&nbsp; And given that we don&rsquo;t have full control over what happens in Europe or the pace at which things happen in Europe, let&rsquo;s make sure that we&rsquo;re doing those things that we do have control over and that are good policy anyway.</p>
<p>
	Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ((inaudible.)</p>
<p>
	THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; I think it&rsquo;s fair to say that any -- all these issues, economic issues, will potentially have some impact on the election.&nbsp; But that&rsquo;s not my biggest concern right now.&nbsp; My biggest concern is the same concern I&rsquo;ve had over the last three and a half years, which is folks who are out of work or underemployed or unable to pay the bills -- what steps are we taking to potentially put them in a stronger position.&nbsp; And I consistently believed that if we take the right policy steps, if we&rsquo;re doing the right thing, then the politics will follow.&nbsp; And my mind hasn&rsquo;t changed on that.</p>
<p>
	Jeff Mason, Reuters.&nbsp; Where&rsquo;s Jeff?</p>
<p>
	Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, sir.&nbsp; My question is about Syria.&nbsp; Did President Putin of Russia indicate any desire on Russia&#39;s part for Assad to step down or to leave power?&nbsp; And did you make any tangible progress in your meetings with him or with Chinese President Hu in finding a way to stop the bloodshed there?</p>
<p>
	PRESIDENT OBAMA:&nbsp; Well, these were major topics of conversation in both meetings.&nbsp; And anybody who&#39;s seen scenes of what&#39;s happening in Syria I think recognizes that the violence is completely out of hand, that civilians are being targeted, and that Assad has lost legitimacy.&nbsp; And when you massacre your own citizens in the ways that we&#39;ve seen, it is impossible to conceive of a orderly political transition that leaves Assad in power.</p>
<p>
	Now, that doesn&rsquo;t mean that that process of political transition is easy.&nbsp; And there&#39;s no doubt that Russia, which historically has had a relationship with Syria, as well as China, which is generally wary of commenting on what it considers to be the internal affairs of other countries, are and have been more resistant to applying the kind of pressure that&#39;s necessary to achieve that political transition.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	We had a very candid conversation.&nbsp; I wouldn&#39;t suggest that at this point the United States and the rest of the international community are aligned with Russia and China in their positions, but I do think they recognize the grave dangers of all-out civil war.&nbsp; I do not think they condone the massacres that we&#39;ve witnessed.&nbsp; And I think they believe that everybody would be better served if Syria had a mechanism for ceasing the violence and creating a legitimate government.</p>
<p>
	What I&#39;ve said to them is that it&#39;s important for the world community to work with the United Nations and Kofi Annan on what a political transition would look like.&nbsp; And my hope is, is that we can have those conversations in the coming week or two and that we can present to the world, but most importantly, to the Syrian people, a pathway whereby this conflict can be resolved.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	But I don&#39;t think it would fair to say that the Russians and the Chinese are signed on at this point.&nbsp; I think what is fair to say is that they recognize that the current situation is grave; it does not serve their interests; it certainly does not serve the interests of the Syrian people.&nbsp; And where we agree is that if we can help the Syrian people find a path to a resolution, all of us would be better off.</p>
<p>
	But it&#39;s my personal belief -- and I shared this with them&nbsp; -- that I don&#39;t see a scenario in which Assad stays and violence is reduced.&nbsp; He had an opportunity with the Annan plan.&nbsp; They did not fulfill their side of the deal.&nbsp; Instead we saw escalation and murder of innocent women and children.&nbsp; And at this point, we have the international monitors that were sent in having to leave because of this violence that&#39;s being perpetrated.&nbsp; And although you&#39;ll hear sometimes from some commentators that the opposition has engaged in violence as well, and obviously there&#39;s evidence of that, I think it&#39;s also fair to say that those haunting images that we saw in places like Hom were the direct result of decisions made by the Syrian government and ultimately Mr. Assad is responsible.</p>
<p>
	Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did either of them talk about Syria without Assad?</p>
<p>
	PRESIDENT OBAMA:&nbsp; We had an intensive conversation about it. If you&#39;re asking me whether they signed on to that proposition, I don&#39;t think it would be fair to say that they are there yet.&nbsp; But my -- I&#39;m going to keep on making the argument and my expectation is, is that at some point there&#39;s a recognition that it&#39;s hard to envision a better future for Syria while Assad is still there.</p>
<p>
	Julianna Goldman.</p>
<p>
	Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Mr. President.&nbsp; One of Mitt Romney&#39;s economic advisors recently wrote in a German publication that your recommendations to Europe and to Germany in particular reveal ignorance of the causes of the crisis, and he said that they have the same flaws as your own economic policies.&nbsp; I want to get your response to that, and also to follow up on Ben&#39;s question.&nbsp; Europe has been kicking the can down the road for years, so why are you any more convinced that we won&#39;t see another three-month fix emerge out of Brussels at the end of the month?</p>
<p>
	PRESIDENT OBAMA:&nbsp; Well, first of all, with respect to Mr. Romney&#39;s advisors, I suggest you go talk to Mr. Romney about his advisors.&nbsp; I would point out that we have one President at a time and one administration at a time, and I think traditionally the notion has been that America&#39;s political differences end at the water&#39;s edge.&nbsp; I&#39;d also suggest that he may not be familiar with what our suggestions to the Germans have been.&nbsp; And I think sometimes back home there is a desire to superimpose whatever ideological arguments are taking place back home on to a very complicated situation in Europe.</p>
<p>
	The situation in Europe is a combination of things.&nbsp; You&#39;ve got situations where some countries did have undisciplined fiscal practices, public debt.&nbsp; You had some countries like Spain whose problems actually arose out of housing speculation and problems in the private sector that didn&rsquo;t have to do with public debt.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	I think that there&#39;s no doubt that all the countries in Europe at this point recognize the need for growth strategies inside of Europe that are consistent with fiscal consolidation plans -- and by the way, that&#39;s exactly what I think the United States should be thinking about.&nbsp; The essence of the plan that I presented back in September was how do we increase growth and jobs now while providing clarity in terms of how we reduce our deficit and our debt medium and long term.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	And I think that&#39;s the right recipe generally -- not just for us, but across the board.</p>
<p>
	You had a second question.&nbsp; What was it?</p>
<p>
	Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why are you --</p>
<p>
	PRESIDENT OBAMA:&nbsp; Why am I confident?&nbsp; Well, look, I don&#39;t want to sound Pollyanna-ish here.&nbsp; Resolving the issues in Europe is difficult.&nbsp; As I said, there are a lot of players involved.&nbsp; There are a lot of complexities to the problems, because we&#39;re talking about the problems of a bunch of different countries at this point.&nbsp; Changing market psychology is very difficult.&nbsp; But the tools are available.&nbsp; The sense of urgency among the leaders is clear.&nbsp; And so what we have to do is combine that sense of urgency with the tools that are available and bridge them in a timely fashion that can provide markets confidence.&nbsp; And I think that can be done.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Hopefully -- just to give an example -- when Spain clarifies exactly how it intends to draw down and utilize dollars -- or not dollars, but euros to recapitalize its banking system, given that it&#39;s already got support from other European countries, given that the resources are available, what&#39;s missing right now is just a sense of specifics and the path whereby that takes place. When markets see that, that can help build confidence and reverse psychology.</p>
<p>
	So there are going to be a range of steps that they can take.&nbsp; None of them are going to be a silver bullet that solves this thing entirely over the next week or two weeks or two months.&nbsp; But each step points to the fact that Europe is moving towards further integration rather than breakup, and that these problems can be resolved -- and points to the underlying strength in Europe&#39;s economies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	These are not countries that somehow at their core are unproductive or dysfunctional; these are advanced economies with extraordinarily productive people.&nbsp; They&rsquo;ve got a particular challenge that has to do with a currency union that didn&rsquo;t have all the best bells and whistles of a fiscal or a monetary union, and they&#39;re catching up now to some of those needs.&nbsp; And they just need the time and the space to do it.&nbsp; In the meantime, they&#39;ve got to send a strong signal to the market, and I&#39;m confident they can do that.</p>
<p>
	All right.&nbsp; Thank you very much, everybody.&nbsp;</p>

	MRS. OBAMA:&nbsp; Yes!&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Whoa!&nbsp; Thank you so much.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; All right, I like it.&nbsp; You all are fired up, right?&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; And ready to go.&nbsp; Four more years!&nbsp; (Applause.)<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	Thank you all so much -- you&rsquo;re so sweet.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; Let me tell you, I am thrilled -- thrilled to be here today, truly.&nbsp; Let me start by just saying a few thank-yous.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s begin with Theresa.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s give her a round of applause for that wonderful introduction.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; And to all of our nurses here who are just making sure that we all keep it together.&nbsp; So let&rsquo;s give them all a round of applause.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	And I know there were a few people who came on before me.&nbsp; I want to thank Wendy for getting everyone fired up.&nbsp; And I also want to thank Ashton, Erin, Helen*, Pastor Trujillo for their remarks earlier and for everything they&rsquo;re doing for our campaign.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	And your Mayor -- good Mayor and your First Lady are here today.&nbsp; Mayor Hafen is here.&nbsp; I got a chance to meet them both.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; How are you?&nbsp; He&rsquo;s nice and tall, so we can see him.&nbsp; But where is your wife?&nbsp; She&rsquo;s smaller.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; And she is here.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; The State Party Chair, Roberta Lange, is here.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; And one of our good friends, Senator Steven Horsford and his family are here.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; He is going to make an outstanding member of Congress.&nbsp; They are a terrific family.&nbsp; We are so proud of them.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	And finally, I want to thank all of you, because you all are extraordinary volunteers and organizers.&nbsp; Thank you for everything that you do, day in and day out, to make this campaign possible -- truly.&nbsp; I know it&rsquo;s warm in here, so you guys hang in there.&nbsp; But I know that you are doing all of the hard work -- you&rsquo;re knocking on those doors, you&rsquo;re making those calls.&nbsp; More importantly, you&rsquo;re registering voters all throughout the state.&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	And I want to thank you for giving folks the information they need about the issues they care about.&nbsp; And I want you to know, truly, that the grassroots work that you all are doing to get people focused and fired up -&ndash; that work is at the core of this campaign.&nbsp; It is truly what is going to make the difference.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s how we did it four years ago, and let me tell you, that&rsquo;s how we&rsquo;re going to do it again this time around as well.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	And I say this to all our volunteers:&nbsp; I know that the work that you&rsquo;re doing, it is not easy.&nbsp; I know that you all are putting in those long hours.&nbsp; And I know that you&rsquo;re doing it in spite of your busy lives.&nbsp; I know that you all -- Amen -- have your own families to raise and your jobs to do.&nbsp; Many of you are finishing school, getting your education together.<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	But I also know that there&rsquo;s a reason why all of us are here today, and why we&rsquo;re doing this work.&nbsp; And it&rsquo;s not just because we support an extraordinary President, which we do -&ndash; my husband, I&rsquo;m a little biased.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; And it&rsquo;s not just because we want to win an election -- although we do, and we will.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	What we all have to remember, though, is that we are doing this because of the values we believe in.&nbsp; I say that everywhere I go.&nbsp; I remind people, it&rsquo;s about our values.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re doing this because of the vision for this country that we all share.&nbsp; Regardless of who we are, we share the same vision.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re doing this because we want all our children in this country to be able to go to those good schools.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; The kind of schools that push them.&nbsp; The kind of schools that inspire them and prepare them for the good jobs and the opportunities for the future.&nbsp; We want that for all of our kids.<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	We want our parents and our grandparents to be able to retire with dignity -&ndash; (applause) -- because we believe that here in America, after a lifetime of hard work, they should be able to enjoy their golden years -- really enjoy that time.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
	We&rsquo;re here because we want to restore that basic middle-class security for all of our families, because we believe that folks shouldn&rsquo;t go bankrupt because somebody gets sick.&nbsp; In America, people shouldn&rsquo;t lose their homes because somebody loses a job.&nbsp; No, not in America.&nbsp; We believe that responsibility should be rewarded, and that hard work should pay off.&nbsp; We believe that everyone should do their fair share, but play by the same rules.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	And the thing that we know, everyone here and around the country -- these are basic American values.&nbsp; This isn&rsquo;t new.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re the values that so many of us were raised with, including myself.&nbsp; And I share my story everywhere I go because it makes me who I am.&nbsp; My father was a blue-collar worker at the city water plant, and my family lived in a little-bitty apartment on the South Side of Chicago.&nbsp; And my parents never had the kinds of educational opportunities my brother and I had.&nbsp; But growing up, let me tell you what my parents did do for us:&nbsp; They saved and they sacrificed everything.&nbsp; They poured everything they had into me and my brother, because they wanted us to have the kind of education they could only dream of.&nbsp; And look what they&rsquo;ve done.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	And like a lot of kids in this country who go to college, pretty much all my college tuition came from student loans and grants, right?&nbsp; How many people can relate to that?&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; But my dad still paid a small portion of that tuition himself.&nbsp; And every semester, he was determined to pay that bill right on time.&nbsp; Because, see, my dad, Fraser, he was so proud to be able to send his kids to college, and he couldn&rsquo;t bear the thought of me or my brother missing a registration deadline because his check was late.<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	My dad is like so many people in this country.&nbsp; My father took great pride in being able to earn a decent living that allowed him to handle his responsibilities to his family.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what gave him joy -- to pay all of his bills, and to pay them all on time.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s all he wanted.&nbsp; And truly, more than anything else, that is what&rsquo;s at stake in this election.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; We can&rsquo;t -- that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re working for.<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	It&rsquo;s that fundamental promise that no matter who you are or how you started out, in America, if you work hard, you can build a decent life for yourself -- yes -- and an even better life for your kids.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what this is about.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; And what we have to know, it is that promise that binds us together as Americans.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s what makes us who we are in this country.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s what makes us special.<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	But now, from now until November, let me tell you something, Barack is going to need all of you out there, and telling everyone you know what&rsquo;s at stake.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Tell them about these values that we share.&nbsp; Remind them about our vision, and about everything that&rsquo;s on the line in this election.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what we need you to do.<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	AUDIENCE MEMBER:&nbsp; We&rsquo;re fired up!<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	MRS. OBAMA:&nbsp; Be fired up.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; And I want you to start by -- just remind people how Barack fought for tax cuts for working families and small businesses.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Those are the tax cuts he&rsquo;s been working to, because an economy that is built to last starts with the middle class and with the kind of folks who are creating jobs and putting people back to work.<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	Remind them how, back when Barack took office, this economy was losing an average of 750,000 jobs a month.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what he inherited.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what he walked into.&nbsp; But also let them know that for the past 27 straight months, this economy has actually been gaining private sector jobs, a total of more than 4 million jobs in just two years.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	So while we still have a long way to go, we still have more work to do to rebuild our economy, let them know that today millions of people are collecting a paycheck again; millions of people like my dad are able to pay their bills again thanks to your President.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	I also want you to tell people about everything that Barack has done to help folks avoid losing their homes to foreclosure.&nbsp; I mean, you can tell them that because of the programs he announced here in Nevada last year, families across this state have been able to refinance their mortgages, and keep their homes, and keep more money in their pockets each month.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve got to remind them.&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	You can also tell people about health care, and how, because of health reform, insurance companies will have to cover preventative care -- things like contraception, cancer screenings and prenatal care, and cover it without any additional cost.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; Remind people about that.&nbsp; People tend to forget.<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	Because of reform, let them know millions of our senior citizens have saved an average of more than $600 a year on their prescription drugs -- thanks to health reform.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	And for the parents out there with college-age students, kids can now stay on their parents&rsquo; insurance until they&rsquo;re 26 years old.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; And understand the effect:&nbsp; That is how 3.1 million more young people are getting the health care they need.&nbsp; So remind people about that.&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	You can tell people how Barack is working to raise standards in our public schools and to make college more affordable for millions of young people, so -- and his vision is that by the end of this decade, more Americans in this country will hold a degree than any other country in the world.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the kind of vision we can all stand by.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	But you also have to tell people how Barack has been fighting for the DREAM Act.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; And understand this -- he&rsquo;s doing this because he believes that it is time to stop denying citizenship to responsible young people just because they&rsquo;re children of undocumented immigrants.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; And just last week, this administration announced new measures to lift the shadow of deportation from many of these young people, who came here as children and were raised as Americans.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	But while this is an important step, it is not a permanent solution.&nbsp; It is not.&nbsp; So Barack is going to keep fighting to get Congress to give these young people a real pathway to citizenship.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the vision that this President has.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	You can remind folks that Barack kept his promise to bring our troops home from Iraq.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; And you can remind them about how our brave men and women in uniform finally brought to justice the man behind the 9/11 attacks.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; And our troops no longer have to lie about who they are to serve the country they love, because Barack ended &ldquo;don&rsquo;t ask, don&rsquo;t tell.&rdquo;<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	But I also want you to tell people that it&rsquo;s now easier for women to get equal pay for equal work -&ndash; (applause) -- and that&rsquo;s because of the first bill Barack signed into law as President of the United States, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act.&nbsp; The first thing he did as President of the United States.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	But let people know why he signed this bill, why this was so important.&nbsp; Because he knows that closing that pay gap, that&nbsp; can mean the difference between women in this country losing $50, $100, $500 from each paycheck, or having that money in their pockets to buy groceries, and school clothes for their kids, and gas -- put gas in their car.&nbsp; Barack did it because when so many women are now breadwinners for our families in this country, women&rsquo;s success in this economy is the key to families&rsquo; success in this economy.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	And finally, don&rsquo;t forget to tell people about those two brilliant Supreme Court Justices Barack appointed, and how, for the first time in history, our daughters and sons watched three women take their seat on our nation&rsquo;s highest court.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	Now I could go on and on and on.&nbsp; But it is warm in here.&nbsp; (Laughter.)&nbsp; And I love you too much to keep you standing up that long.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s also important for people to remind folks that all of this and so much more is at stake this November.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s all on the line.&nbsp; And in the end it all boils down to one simple question:&nbsp; Will we continue the change we&rsquo;ve begun and the progress we&rsquo;ve made?&nbsp; Or will we allow everything we&rsquo;ve worked for to just slip away?<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	AUDIENCE:&nbsp; No!<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	MRS. OBAMA:&nbsp; No!&nbsp; We know what we need to do.&nbsp; We cannot turn back now.&nbsp; We need to keep moving forward.&nbsp; We need to keep moving forward.&nbsp; And more than anything else, that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re working for.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s all about -&ndash; it&rsquo;s the chance to finish what we started; the chance to keep fighting for the values we believe in and the vision we all share.<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	And that&rsquo;s what my husband has been doing every single day as President of the United States.&nbsp; And let me just tell you -- let me share something with you.&nbsp; Because, as First Lady, over the past three-and-a-half years, I have had the chance to see up close and personal what being President looks like.&nbsp; I know a little something about it now.&nbsp; And I have seen how the issues that come across a President&rsquo;s desk are always the hard ones -&ndash; the problems with no easy solutions; the judgment calls where the stakes are so high, and there is no margin for error.&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	And as President, you&rsquo;re going to get all kinds of advice and opinions from all kinds of people.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s for sure.&nbsp; But at the end of the day, when it comes time to make that decision, as President, understand, all you have to guide you are your life experiences.&nbsp; All you have to draw on are your values, your vision for this country.&nbsp; In the end, it all boils down to who you are and what you stand for.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	And the reason why I am up here so passionate is because we all know who my husband is, right?&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; We all know what Barack Obama stands for.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; He&rsquo;s the son of a single mother who struggled to put herself through school and pay the bills.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s who he is.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s the grandson of a woman who woke up before dawn every day to catch her bus to a job at a bank.&nbsp; And even though Barack&rsquo;s grandmother worked hard to help support his family, and she was good at her job, he watched -- like so many women, she hit that glass ceiling.&nbsp; And men no more qualified than she was were promoted up the ladder ahead of her.&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	So what I want everybody to understand about their President is that he understands what it means when a family struggles.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s not new to him.&nbsp; He knows what it means when someone doesn&rsquo;t have a chance to fulfill their potential.&nbsp; And let me tell you, today, as a father, he knows what it means to want something better for your kids.&nbsp; Those are the experiences that have made him the man and the President he is today.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	So when you think about who you&#39;re going to work for, understand when it comes time to stand up for American workers and American families, you know what Barack Obama is going to do, right?&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; When there&rsquo;s a choice about protecting our rights and our freedoms -- all of us -- you know where Barack stands.&nbsp; And when we need a leader to make the hard decisions to keep this country moving forward, you know you can count on Barack Obama because that is what he&rsquo;s been doing every single day as President of the United States.&nbsp; (Applause.)<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	That&rsquo;s why I&#39;m here, and that&rsquo;s why I&#39;m going to be out there.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; But I have said this before -- I have said it before, and I will say it everywhere I go -- Barack cannot do this alone.&nbsp; Barack needs you so fired up.&nbsp; He needs your help.&nbsp; He needs you to keep doing what you&#39;re doing.&nbsp; Keep making those calls, right?&nbsp; Keep knocking on those doors.&nbsp; Keep registering those voters.&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	And even more important, he needs you to multiply yourselves.&nbsp; No, I mean this -- multiply yourselves.&nbsp; Reach out to everyone you know -- friends, family, neighbors.&nbsp; Tell them to go to barackobama.com.&nbsp; Find out how they -- help them find out how they can get started just giving a little part of themselves each week to this campaign.&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	Multiply yourselves.&nbsp; Because as Barack said, this election will be even closer than the last one.&nbsp; That is a guarantee.&nbsp;<br />
	And if you have any doubt about the difference that you will make, I just want you to remember that in the end, this election is going to come down to those last few thousand people that you register to vote.&nbsp; Think like that.<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	It&#39;s going to come down to those last few thousand folks that you help get to the polls.&nbsp; That will make the difference.&nbsp; And I just want you to think for a minute about what these numbers can mean when they&#39;re spread out over an entire state.&nbsp; It might mean registering just one more person in your town -- truly.&nbsp; Understand this.&nbsp; It might mean just helping one more person in your community get to the polls on Election Day.<br />
	Day.&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	So please, with every door you knock on, with every event you host, with every conversation you have -- in the store, at church, in the pick-up line -- I want you to remember that this could be the one that makes the difference.&nbsp; And it can make the difference -- people having the right information about who their President is and what he has done.<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	That is the kind of impact each of you will have.&nbsp; Understand that.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s why we work so hard.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s why we&#39;re in this.&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	But I&rsquo;m not going to kid you, this journey will definitely be long, and it is going to be hard.&nbsp; And there will be plenty of twists and turns along the way -- that is a guarantee.&nbsp; But we have to remember that is how change always happens in this country.&nbsp; But if we keep showing up, if we keep fighting the good fight, fighting for the things we know are right, then eventually we get there.&nbsp; We always do, we always have.&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	AUDIENCE:&nbsp; Yes!<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	MRS. OBAMA:&nbsp; Maybe not in our lifetimes, but here&#39;s the thing -- maybe in our children&rsquo;s lifetimes.&nbsp; Maybe in our grandchildren&rsquo;s lifetimes.<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	Because in the end, that&rsquo;s what this is all about.&nbsp; It&#39;s about them.&nbsp; And that&rsquo;s what I think about when I tuck my girls in at night.&nbsp; Every night when I leave them and I&#39;m here, I think about them, and I think about the world that I want to leave for them and for all of our sons and daughters.&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	I think about how I want them to do -- I want to do for them what my Dad did for me.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; I want to give all our kids that solid foundation for their dreams -- all of them.&nbsp; I want to give them opportunities worthy of their promise -- because all kids have promise.&nbsp; I want to give them that sense of limitless possibility; that belief that here in America, there&rsquo;s always something better if you&rsquo;re willing to work for it.&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	So we cannot turn back now.&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	AUDIENCE:&nbsp; No!<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	MRS. OBAMA:&nbsp; No, we can&#39;t turn back now.&nbsp; We have come so far, but we have so much more to do.<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	So let me ask you one last question:&nbsp; Are you all in?<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	AUDIENCE:&nbsp; Yes!&nbsp; (Applause.)<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	MRS. OBAMA:&nbsp; No, no, are you really in?<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	AUDIENCE:&nbsp; Yes!&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	MRS. OBAMA:&nbsp; Are you ready for this work?&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	AUDIENCE:&nbsp; Yes!<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	MRS. OBAMA:&nbsp; Are you ready to roll up your sleeves?&nbsp; Are you ready to multiply yourselves?&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	AUDIENCE:&nbsp; Yes!<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	MRS. OBAMA:&nbsp; You know what we&#39;re working for.&nbsp; You understand that vision, and it&#39;s a vision that everyone in this country shares -- you know it and I know it.<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	So let&#39;s get to work.&nbsp; I am so fired up.<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	Thank you all.&nbsp; God bless.&nbsp; (Applause.)</p>
<p>

<p>
	PRESIDENT OBAMA:&nbsp; I just want to say that it&rsquo;s a great pleasure once again to have this bilateral meeting with President Hu.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Over the last several years, as a consequence of not only extensive one-on-one meetings, but also because of the outstanding work that our teams have done through the strategic and economic dialogue, we have been able to really create a new model for practical and constructive and comprehensive relations between our two countries.</p>
<p>
	Obviously, as two of the largest economies in the world, much of our focus has been on increasing trade and commerce between our two countries in a way that creates mutual benefits, and we have made significant progress in not only our bilateral relations, but also in helping to manage through some very difficult economic crises.</p>
<p>
	We&#39;ve also been able to cooperate on a range of regional issues relating to the Asia Pacific region, but also with respect to conflict and security challenges around the world.</p>
<p>
	In the wake of the G20, this will be a good opportunity for us to recap the work that both China and the United States have to do to sustain global economic growth and to make sure that we are creating jobs and opportunity for our citizens.</p>
<p>
	And I&rsquo;m also looking forward to having the opportunity to discuss some immediate issues that the world confronts -- being able to discuss Iran, North Korea, and the challenges of curbing nuclear proliferation.&nbsp; This will also give us an opportunity to discuss the situation in Syria, and to arrive at a cooperative approach that can end the bloodshed there and lead to the kind of legitimate government that I think we all hope for.</p>
<p>
	So once again, I want to thank President Hu for his leadership both in the G20 and in helping to nurture the kind of cooperative relationship that we&rsquo;ve developed.&nbsp; And I look forward very much to our discussion.</p>
<p>
	PRESIDENT HU:&nbsp; (As interpreted.)&nbsp; I&rsquo;m delighted to meet with you, Mr. President, again.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s already our 12th meeting.&nbsp; In March this year, you and I had very close in Seoul, Korea, and over the past three months, the working teams of both countries have been working in real earnest to follow through with the important agreement you and I reached.&nbsp; And we have made new progress in developing a cooperative partnership between China and the United States.</p>
<p>
	Building a good, stable, and productive China-U.S. relationship is in our mutual interest of our two countries and our two peoples, and also contributes to peace and development.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	China is willing to work together with the United States to remain firmly committed to building a cooperative partnership.&nbsp; We are willing to work with the United States to continue building trust and cooperation, appropriately handle disagreements and sensitive issues, and continue to move forward with this cooperative partnership on a sustained, steady and sound course.</p>
<p>
	I highly appreciate the important role played by President Obama in promoting the growth of this relationship.&nbsp; I believe that the talks we are going to have are going to be conducted in a sincere, friendly and productive manner.</p>
<p>
	PRESIDENT OBAMA:&nbsp; Thank you.</p>

"><em>The Los Cabos Growth and Jobs Action Plan</em></a> starts from the premise that cooperation and coordination will result in better economic outcomes. We are united in our commitment to take strong and decisive action to deliver on the commitments set out below.</p>
<p>
	We have agreed that, in light of what are perceived to be the most significant risks, our policy actions should focus on:</p>
<p>
	&bull;&nbsp;Addressing decisively the sovereign debt and banking crisis in the Euro Area. The Euro Area authorities have taken a number of relevant and critical actions that have helped to stabilise the situation, however, significant risks remain and further action is required.<br />
	&bull;&nbsp;Ensuring financial stability, including dealing with the potential impacts of deleveraging.<br />
	&bull;&nbsp;Boosting demand and economic growth, and reducing persistently high and rising unemployment in many advanced economies, especially among young people.<br />
	&bull;&nbsp;Ensuring the pace of fiscal consolidation in advanced economies is appropriate to support the recovery, taking country-specific circumstances into account and, in line with the Toronto Commitments, addressing concerns about medium-term fiscal sustainability.<br />
	&bull;&nbsp;Dealing with the possibility that geopolitical risks might lead to a supply-induced sustained spike in oil prices, in an environment of limited spare capacity and modest inventories.<br />
	&bull;&nbsp;Ensuring emerging markets maintain a strong and sustainable growth path that contributes to the global recovery and quality job creation.<br />
	&bull;&nbsp;Resisting protectionism and keeping markets open.</p>
<p>
	Our ability to successfully address these risks is influenced by our ability to take stronger actions to promote stability and growth, and reduce ongoing imbalances, including by encouraging the rotation of demand from the public to the private sector in countries with fiscal deficits and from the external to the domestic sector in countries with current account surpluses. We are in full agreement that we need to intensify our efforts to reduce both internal and external imbalances.</p>
<p>
	As we agreed in Cannes, we have established the <em>Los Cabos Accountability Assessment Framework</em> (Annex A) to assess progress in meeting commitments toward our shared goal of strong, sustainable and balanced growth. This Framework is based on three pillars. First, guiding principles to ensure the assessments are: country-owned; based on a comply or explain approach; concrete; consistent across members; fair; open and transparent. Second, a peer review process that includes review and discussion of members&rsquo; policies and in-depth assessments from the international organisations. Finally, annual reports to Leaders summarising the outcomes of the assessments.</p>
<p>
	We have conducted our first assessment under this framework (Annex B). We have agreed that the commitments set out in the Cannes Action Plan to promote recovery and lay the foundation for robust growth and job creation remain broadly appropriate. The recent intensification of risks, however, has increased the importance of implementing and building upon the Cannes commitments. Progress has been good in meeting some elements of the Cannes Action Plan, but in several areas more progress is needed. We will undertake ongoing accountability assessments and improve our tracking of measures to assess progress as set out in the <em>Los Cabos Accountability Framework</em>.</p>
<p>
	The Los Cabos Action Plan, as set out below, includes a combination of policy measures, with short- and medium-term impacts, in order to ensure that policy credibility is enhanced and to reflect the different capacities of countries to respond in particular areas.</p>
<p>
	<strong><em>Addressing Near-term Risks, Restoring Confidence, and Promoting Growth</em></strong></p>
<p>
	Central to this plan is a common agreement that the strongest actions to minimize risks and spur growth are those that promote the stability and proper functioning of our financial systems, supported by fiscal and monetary policy actions.</p>
<p>
	To address near-term risks, promote confidence, ensure economic and financial stability, and bolster the economic recovery, we have agreed on the following actions.</p>
<p>
	1. The Euro Area members of the G20 will take all necessary measures to safeguard the integrity and stability of the area, improve the functioning of financial markets and break the feedback loop between sovereigns and banks.<br />
	&bull;&nbsp;We welcome the significant actions taken since the last summit by the Euro Area to support growth, ensure financial stability and promote fiscal responsibility. In this context, we welcome Spain&rsquo;s plan to recapitalize its banking system and the Eurogroup&rsquo;s announcement of support for Spain&rsquo;s financial restructuring authority. The adoption of the Fiscal Compact and its ongoing implementation, together with growth-enhancing policies and structural reform, are important steps towards greater fiscal and economic integration. The imminent establishment of the European Stability Mechanism is a substantial strengthening of the European firewalls.<br />
	&bull;&nbsp;We fully support the actions of the Euro Area in moving forward with the completion of the Economic and Monetary Union. Towards that end, we support the intention to consider concrete steps towards a more integrated financial architecture, encompassing banking supervision, resolution and recapitalization, and deposit insurance.<br />
	&bull;&nbsp;Euro area members will foster intra Euro Area adjustment through structural reforms to strengthen competitiveness in deficit countries and to promote demand and growth in surplus countries.<br />
	&bull;&nbsp;The European Union members of the G20 are determined to move forward expeditiously on measures to support growth including through completing the European Single Market and making better use of European financial means, such as the EIB, pilot project bonds, and structural and cohesion funds, for more targeted investment, employment, growth and competitiveness, while maintaining the firm commitment to implement fiscal consolidation to be assessed on a structural basis.</p>
<p>
	2. Fiscal policies in all of our economies will focus on strengthening and sustaining the recovery in a manner which promotes fiscal sustainability and enhances policy credibility.<br />
	&bull;&nbsp;Advanced economies are generally on track to meet their near term commitment to halve deficits between 2010 and 2013. Advanced economies are committed to meeting the medium term Toronto commitments by implementing credible medium-term fiscal consolidation plans.<br />
	&bull;&nbsp;Recognizing the need to pursue growth-oriented policies that support demand and recovery, the United States will calibrate the pace of its fiscal consolidation by ensuring that its public finances are placed on a sustainable long-run path so that a sharp fiscal contraction in 2013 is avoided.<br />
	&bull;&nbsp;Japan will implement reconstruction spending as expeditiously as possible.<br />
	&bull;&nbsp;Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Germany, Indonesia, Korea, the UK and the US are allowing automatic fiscal stabilisers to operate, taking into account national circumstances and current demand conditions.<br />
	&bull;&nbsp;Italy will deliver on its agenda of frontloaded fiscal consolidation accompanied by growth-enhancing measures.<br />
	&bull;&nbsp;Fiscal policy in Spain will remain focussed on consolidation.</p>
<p>
	3. Monetary policies will remain focused on maintaining price stability and sustaining the global economic recovery. In this context, the actions taken by central banks in advanced economies have played an important role in promoting global economic growth and stability. Central banks will remain vigilant and take action as appropriate to achieve their objectives.</p>
<p>
	4. Our central banks, financial market supervisors and treasuries will remain in close dialogue and will cooperate through the FSB to maintain financial stability during this period of heightened uncertainty. We will maintain momentum on the financial sector institutional reforms needed to safeguard our financial systems over the medium term while taking appropriate actions to protect credit channels and the integrity of global payment and settlement systems.</p>
<p>
	5. Should economic conditions deteriorate significantly further, Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Germany, Korea, Russia and the US stand ready to coordinate and implement additional measures to support demand, taking into account national circumstances and commitments.</p>
<p>
	6. Emerging markets will adjust their macroeconomic policies to support domestic demand, while ensuring price stability. When and where appropriate, macro-prudential measures will also be used to help manage domestic credit growth and liquidity.</p>
<p>
	7. Recognizing that geopolitical risks might lead to a supply-side induced spike in oil prices, in an environment of limited spare capacity and modest inventories, members stand ready to take additional actions as needed. We welcome the commitments by producing countries to ensure adequate supply. In particular, we welcome Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s readiness to mobilize, as necessary, more than 2.5 million barrels per day of existing spare capacity.</p>
<p>
	8. In all policy areas, we commit to minimize the negative spillovers on other countries of policies implemented for domestic purposes. We reaffirm our shared interest in a strong and stable international financial system and our support for market-determined exchange rates. We reiterate that excess volatility and disorderly movements in exchange rates have adverse implications for economic and financial stability.</p>
<p>
	<strong><em>Strengthening the Medium-term Foundations for Growth</em></strong></p>
<p>
	All members agree to build on the 6-point plan developed in Cannes to boost confidence, raise global output and create jobs, focussing on priority areas.</p>
<p>
	1. Advanced economies will ensure their fiscal finances are on a sustainable track.<br />
	&bull;&nbsp;Recognizing the importance of strengthening and implementing their medium-term fiscal consolidation plans, the US and Japan commit to actions that will lead to steady reduction in their public debt-to-GDP ratios:<br />
	&bull;&nbsp;The US commits to placing its federal debt-to-GDP ratio on a firm downward path by 2016 through a balanced approach.<br />
	&bull;&nbsp;Japan reaffirms its commitment to meet its primary balances targets for FY2015 and FY2020, and to reduce its debt-to-GDP ratio from FY2021 onwards.<br />
	&bull;&nbsp;By our next Summit, members agree to identify credible and ambitious country-specific targets for the debt-to-GDP ratio beyond 2016, where these do not currently exist, accompanied by clear strategies and timetables to achieve them. These strategies will consider tax and expenditure reforms, including modifications to entitlements.</p>
<p>
	2. We will intensify our efforts to rebalance global demand, through increasing domestic demand in countries with current account surpluses, rotating demand from the public to private sector in countries with fiscal deficits and increasing national savings in countries with current account deficits.<br />
	&bull;&nbsp;The reduction of structural fiscal deficits and actions to promote private savings in advanced economies with current account deficits will contribute to a lasting reduction in global imbalances (US).<br />
	&bull;&nbsp;We reaffirm our commitment to move more rapidly toward market-determined exchange rate systems and enhance exchange rate flexibility to reflect underlying fundamentals, avoid persistent exchange rate misalignments, and refrain from competitive devaluation of currencies. We recognize the important decisions to increase the fluctuation bands for the exchange rates in China and Russia. China is building on its commitment to gradually reduce the pace of reserve accumulation, and to allow market forces to play a larger role in determining movements of the RMB and to increase the transparency of its exchange rate policy. We welcome China&rsquo;s commitment to continue exchange rate regime reform.<br />
	&bull;&nbsp;Emerging markets will take further actions to rebalance demand, including by: continuing to promote the liberalization of interest rates (China); and, increasing investment (Brazil) and savings rates (Turkey).<br />
	&bull;&nbsp;Advanced surplus economies or those with relatively weak private demand will help promote domestic demand through the further liberalization of service sectors ( Korea, Germany, Japan); encouraging investment through eliminating inefficiencies (Germany); and, creating new industries and new markets through innovation in areas such as environment and healthcare (Japan). The recent developments in private households&rsquo; real income in Germany will help strengthen domestic demand and accelerate internal rebalancing within the Euro Area.<br />
	&bull;&nbsp;Oil-exporting countries will continue to pursue productive public investment and encourage private investment, which will have positive regional and global spillover effects, while ensuring fiscal sustainability given the volatile nature of revenues.</p>
<p>
	3. In Cannes, countries put forward structural reform commitments to boost and sustain global demand, foster job creation, contribute to global rebalancing and increase the growth potential in all G-20 countries. These remain core priorities going forward and are reflected in additional reforms and commitments made since Cannes. These reforms include:<br />
	&bull;&nbsp;Labour market reforms to increase employment and increase labour force participation, such as: retraining long-term unemployed (US); skills development (Spain); increasing wage flexibility, such as decentralizing wage setting (Italy); reducing labour tax wedges (Brazil, Italy); reforms to employment insurance to make it more effective and efficient in supporting job creation (Canada); enhancing education, training and skills development (Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Turkey, South Africa); encouraging the participation of females in the labour force by, for example, reforming benefit systems and providing affordable child care services (Australia, Germany, Japan, Korea); improving employment opportunities for targeted groups such as youth and persons with disabilities (Canada, Korea, UK); encouraging the participation of younger workers through apprenticeships (UK); and, encouraging formal sector employment through better education or skill development (Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico, South Africa).<br />
	&bull;&nbsp;Product market reforms to promote competition and enhance productivity in key sectors (Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Mexico);<br />
	&bull;&nbsp;Actions to promote the stabilisation of the housing sector (US).<br />
	&bull;&nbsp;Providing targeted support for the poor or strengthening social safety nets (India, Indonesia, China, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, South Africa).<br />
	&bull;&nbsp;Phasing out distortive subsidies in the medium-term where they exist in both advanced and emerging economies.<br />
	&bull;&nbsp;Tax and benefit reforms to enhance productivity and improve incentives to work (Australia, Germany, Italy, UK);<br />
	&bull;&nbsp;Planning regulation reforms to better support economic growth by reducing the burdens facing businesses wishing to expand (UK);<br />
	&bull;&nbsp;Encourage further trade liberalization through unilateral tariff elimination in key sectors (Canada);<br />
	&bull;&nbsp;Promote investments in infrastructure to increase productivity and living standards in the medium term by addressing bottlenecks (Argentina, Australia, Brazil, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, UK); and,<br />
	&bull;&nbsp;Commitments to promote green and sustainable growth (Australia, Korea, Germany, Mexico).</p>
<p>
	4. We have made substantial progress in strengthening financial sector regulation and supervision. Current global economic challenges underscore the need to reaffirm our commitment to the effective implementation of the agreed financial reforms in order to make the financial sector more resilient, stable and able to support economic growth. We welcome the FSB&rsquo;s work, in conjunction with the IMF and the World Bank, identifying the extent to which agreed regulatory reforms may have unintended consequences for EMDEs. G-20 members continue to look to the FSB, in cooperation with standard setters, to monitor progress, reporting back on a regular basis. This will be complemented by efforts to increase financial inclusion.</p>
<p>
	5. We reaffirm our commitment to resist protectionism in all forms and promote open trade, and will take active measures to reduce the number of WTO inconsistent trade restrictive measures and resist financial protectionism.</p>
<p>
	6. Members reiterate the commitment on actions to maximize growth potential and economic resilience in developing countries, as well as the importance of fulfilling aid commitments by advanced countries, and mobilizing domestic, external, and new innovative sources of finance to meet development needs. These actions will complement the efforts of multilateral and bilateral donors, public and private partners to assist developing countries in achieving the Millennium Development Goals. Emerging market members will also promote a range of reforms to promote development, including improving the investment climate and enhancing infrastructure investment.</p>
<p>
	Details on country-specific reform commitments are posted on the Mexican Presidency&rsquo;s website. We will continue to coordinate policy in the future as economic conditions evolve. We ask our Finance Ministers to work closely together in the coming months to address vulnerabilities and sustain the recovery. We will review progress against all of our commitments at the St. Petersburg Summit in 2013.&nbsp;</p>

	<strong>ANNEX A:</strong></p>
<p class="rtecenter">
	<strong>THE LOS CABOS ACCOUNTABILITY ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK</strong></p>
<p>
	G-20 members have developed an Accountability Assessment Framework based on three pillars. This Framework will be used to prepare reports on progress in meeting past commitments, which will inform the development of future action plans and domestic policies.</p>
<p>
	<em><strong>Guiding Principles</strong></em></p>
<p>
	To make sure that the Framework meets the needs of the membership, members have agreed that it be:</p>
<p>
	&bull;&nbsp;Country-owned and country-led, based on the members&rsquo; assessment and with the input of independent third-party evaluations (by the IMF and other international organizations).<br />
	&bull;&nbsp;Based on a rigorous comply or explain approach, which recognizes that policy actions take time and policy priorities may need to change.<br />
	&bull;&nbsp;Concrete, using quantitative measures where possible to help focus the discussion and assess progress.<br />
	&bull;&nbsp;Consistent across members, to ensure comparability of treatment, while at the same time allowing for country-specific circumstances where relevant.<br />
	&bull;&nbsp;Fair, by encouraging an open dialogue between members through self-assessments and by providing objective, third-party analysis.<br />
	&bull;&nbsp;Open and transparent, with the overall outcomes communicated to the public after agreement by the G-20.</p>
<p>
	<strong><em>1. A Peer-Review Process informed by Third-Party Assessments</em></strong></p>
<p>
	At the core of our accountability assessment is a peer review process, in which members will assess progress made in meeting past G-20 fiscal, financial, structural, monetary and exchange rate, trade and development policy commitments. To enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of the discussions, the process focuses on those commitments across all policy areas where the coordination of policies has the most impact in reducing near term risks, and promoting strong, sustainable and balanced growth.</p>
<p>
	The peer review discussions will include the following elements:</p>
<p>
	&bull;&nbsp;A review and discussion of policy actions members have undertaken to meet their commitments.<br />
	&bull;&nbsp;A discussion of the global economic outlook to assess the progress being made in moving towards our objectives of strong, sustainable and balanced growth.<br />
	&bull;&nbsp;An assessment of members (approximately every 2 years) against the &lsquo;Indicative Guidelines&rsquo; that we endorsed in Cannes in order to identify large and persistent imbalances. As well, discussions of the new (or updated) External Sustainability Reports prepared by the IMF for countries where the guidelines suggest imbalances require further analysis.<br />
	&bull;&nbsp;A review of reports from the international organisations (from the IMF, OECD, FSB, World Bank, ILO UNCTAD and the WTO) to enhance the objectiveness of the assessment process.</p>
<p>
	To ensure the Framework&rsquo;s credibility and integrity, we task our officials with further enhancing the Accountability Assessment Framework, by looking at ways to promote peer review discussions based on a shared understanding of issues. We are committed to agreeing on a common approach to measure progress against previous commitments in the areas of fiscal, monetary, exchange rate, and other policies. As well we agree that commitments need to be specific, measurable and relevant to achieving strong, sustainable and balanced growth. We task our Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors to review progress by their meeting in Mexico City in November 2012.</p>
<p>
	<em><strong>2. Regular Reports to Ministers/Governors/Leaders</strong></em></p>
<p>
	The culmination of the peer review discussions will be short progress reports prepared for Ministerial meetings and regular Annual Accountability Assessments for Ministers, Governors and Leaders. These assessments would also provide critical input to inform the range of concrete policy commitments that should be included in the G-20 Action Plans.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="rtecenter">
	<strong>ANNEX B:</strong></p>
<p class="rtecenter">
	<strong>The Los Cabos Accountability Assessment</strong></p>
<p>
	The G-20 launched the Framework for Strong, Sustainable and Balanced Growth in Pittsburgh in 2009 to promote the range of policy actions required to overcome the legacy of the 2007-08 financial crisis and put the global economy back on the path of strong, sustainable and balanced economic growth and robust job creation. The bold policy actions undertaken by G-20 countries in response to the crisis limited the loss of output and jobs, and launched the global recovery.</p>
<p>
	While significant policy actions have been implemented since then, our common goal of achieving strong, sustainable and balanced growth as agreed in Pittsburgh has remained elusive. It is clear that the rebuilding of public and private sector balance sheets across advanced economies will continue to constrain global growth for some time. Further, a number of risks continue to weigh heavily on global growth as outlined above. The recovery in private demand in most advanced economies remains muted. Although growth in emerging market economies has remained relatively strong, there are indications that it too is slowing. Reflecting the differential growth profiles, unemployment rates in emerging market economies have generally fallen below pre-crisis levels, while unemployment rates in advanced economies generally remain stubbornly high.</p>
<p>
	External imbalances have generally narrowed compared to the very large imbalances in the pre-crisis period. Structural policy adjustments have played a role in some countries, but the improvement also reflects cyclical effects, in particular the relatively weak cyclical position of many advanced economies and movements in terms of trade. Oil-exporting countries continue to run large and mounting current account surpluses.</p>
<p>
	On balance, developments since Pittsburgh suggest that a continued and more determined effort across all policy areas is required to meet the objectives set out when we established the Framework.</p>
<p>
	<u>Fiscal Policy</u></p>
<p>
	Good progress has been achieved in meeting the Toronto fiscal commitments, although the weaker-than-expected economic outcomes has affected the fiscal adjustment paths of some countries. In some countries the credibility of fiscal policy needs to be bolstered through actions to place public finances on a sustainable medium-term path:</p>
<p>
	&bull;&nbsp;Most members (Australia, Canada, France, Germany and Italy) are projected by the IMF to achieve the Toronto target to halve their deficits from their 2010 levels.1 In some cases, strong policy actions actually reduced the 2010 deficits below expected levels. Recognizing the need to pursue growth-oriented policies that support demand and recovery, the United States will calibrate the pace of its fiscal consolidation by ensuring that its public finances are placed on a sustainable long-run path so that a sharp fiscal contraction in 2013 is avoided. In the UK, the actual 2013 deficit projection meets the Toronto objective when cyclically-adjusted measure is used. Spain may miss its 2013 target, reflecting the significant weakness in the economy and the restructuring of its banking sector. Thus, a very significant structural effort and deficit reduction plan is being implemented.<br />
	&bull;&nbsp;Most advanced economies are also on track to achieve the Toronto commitment to stabilise or reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio by 2016.2 The US is expected to meet this commitment in 2016 at the federal government level, but the federal government debt is expected to increase thereafter according to the IMF. Spain is expected to require additional actions to meet its target. Japan is on track to meet its own medium-term target of halving the primary deficit by FY2015 from its FY2010 level, but more action is needed to reach its long-term target to reduce its debt-to-GDP ratio from FY2021 onwards. Finally, while advanced economies had agreed to promote sustainable fiscal finances over the medium term, debt levels are expected to remain high in many countries in 2016. Further policy efforts are required to achieve sustainable public finances in the medium term, particularly in the context of population ageing.</p>
<p>
	Member countries have made progress on their commitments to implement structural fiscal reforms. The Euro Area has strengthened its fiscal frameworks with the adoption of the Fiscal Compact. Some members have delivered on their commitment to reform the pension system (Italy) and others are making progress on pension reforms (France, the UK). Brazil has approved a reform of the civil servants&rsquo; pension system. Spain has implemented a major labour market reform. Further progress is required on a range of fiscal actions across G-20 members that would both promote sustainable public finances and facilitate global rebalancing: the Euro Area needs to complete reforms to fiscal governance; and, the US and Japan need to fully implement ambitious medium-term fiscal plans. India, Indonesia and Mexico need to continue their reforms of major subsidies. Further progress on tax reform is required in many emerging and advanced economies to reduce distortions.</p>
<p>
	<u>Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies</u></p>
<p>
	In advanced economies, monetary policies have played an integral role in supporting the recovery while maintaining price stability. In emerging market economies, inflationary pressures have generally eased, largely as a result of slower growth.<br />
	Since the Pittsburgh Summit, emerging market economies with relatively inflexible exchange rate regimes, under the IMF&rsquo;s de facto classification system, implemented a number of important reforms. In particular, both China and Russia have widened their exchange rate floating bands. China&rsquo;s exchange rate has appreciated substantially since 2005, but progress towards greater exchange rate flexibility has been less clear since the Cannes Summit, particularly given the short time that China&rsquo;s most recent reforms have been in place. Reserves fell in China during the last quarter of 2011 partly owing to the narrowing in its current account surplus. Reserve accumulation resumed in the first quarter of 2012.</p>
<p>
	Emerging market countries expressed concerns that the easing in monetary policies in advanced economies is contributing to an increase in both the level and variability of capital flowing to their<br />
	economies and volatility in other financial variables, complicating macroeconomic policy management. Members generally recognised that domestic monetary policies of advanced economies are appropriately targeted to achieve domestic objectives while at the same time recognising the need to remain vigilant against possible negative spillovers of their policies.</p>
<p>
	<u>Structural Policies</u></p>
<p>
	The implementation of key structural reforms is critical to strengthening growth and creating jobs, and promoting global rebalancing, such as policies that affect social safety nets and investment patterns. However, members agreed that structural reform commitments are particularly difficult to assess, in part due to the length of time it takes to implement them and witness their effects. That said, members remain committed to pursuing structural reforms as not only are some reforms able to provide employment gains in the short-term, they also boost jobs and growth domestically and have positive spillovers via trade and other linkages to help rebalance the global economy.</p>
<p>
	The OECD estimates that implementation is underway for over three quarters of all structural reform commitments, with full implementation of about one-third of all commitments. Progress in implementing reforms is broadly similar for advanced and emerging economies. However, progress across the different categories of structural reforms has been uneven and greater ambition is needed to implement the reforms that will have the greatest impact on rebalancing, job creation, and promoting stronger growth.</p>
<p>
	Several advanced economies need to make more progress on product market reforms (Euro Area, Japan). Emerging markets, in general, need to further improve the business and investment environment, which will facilitate investment in infrastructure and enhance potential growth, and foster financial inclusion. To facilitate global rebalancing: the US needs to do more to encourage private savings; Germany should implement measures to promote domestic demand; and, some emerging markets need to increase domestic consumption and improve the efficiency of investment.</p>
<p>
	<u>Trade, Financial Sector and Development Policies</u></p>
<p>
	The WTO, UNCTAD, World Bank and OECD continue to monitor progress countries have made in reducing tariffs and liberalizing trading systems, including reducing entry barriers in key sectors. Most members have maintained their commitment to resist protectionism, including by addressing unfair trade practices through WTO-consistent trade remedy measures rather than ad-hoc policy responses. However, the political climate in some regions appears to be more accepting of new forms of protectionist measures, which should be resisted.</p>
<p>
	The FSB is responsible for coordinating and promoting the rigorous monitoring of the implementation of the agreed G-20/FSB financial reforms and its reporting to the G-20 under the FSB&rsquo;s Coordination Framework for Implementation Monitoring (CFIM) that was established last year. This process involves intensive monitoring and detailed reporting, in collaboration with the standard setting bodies, on national implementation progress in six priority reform areas (Basel III, policy measures for G-SIFIs, resolution frameworks, OTC derivatives, compensation practices, shadow banking) as set out in the FSB&rsquo;s report to G-20 Leaders. The FSB, in coordination with relevant standard setting bodies, also reports on the implementation of other agreed regulatory reforms and publishes information on the 12 steps taken by FSB members to implement them. The IMF reviews progress realized by its members via its Article IV surveillance and FSAP assessments. The FSB, in coordination with the staff of the IMF and World Bank, has prepared a study identifying the extent to which agreed regulatory reforms may have unintended consequences on emerging market and developing economies.<br />
	The World Bank, in conjunction with other international organizations, will continue to assess the growth and development agenda in developing countries, including the impact of the Framework policies and the external environment on promoting development and reducing the development gap. In addition, they continue to monitor the progress towards fulfilling commitments in this area.</p>
<p>
	<u>Conclusion</u></p>
<p>
	Overall, progress has been made in moving ahead on the Cannes and previous summit reform commitments, but more progress and new actions are required in several important areas. In order to facilitate future assessments, members also recognised that policy commitments need to be as specific and concrete as possible, and need to substantively contribute towards the overall objective of strong, sustainable and balanced growth. We also agree on the need for a common approach to measure progress against previous commitments in all policy areas.</p>

	1. We, the Leaders of the G20, convened in Los Cabos on 18-19 June 2012.</p>
<p>
	2. We are united in our resolve to promote growth and jobs.</p>
<p>
	3. Since we last met, the global recovery has continued to face a number of challenges. Financial market tensions are high. External, fiscal and financial imbalances are still prevalent, having a major impact on growth and employment prospects and confidence. Clearly, the global economy remains vulnerable, with a negative impact on the everyday lives of people all over the world, affecting jobs, trade, development, and the environment.</p>
<p>
	4. We will act together to strengthen recovery and address financial market tensions.</p>
<p>
	5. We will work collectively to strengthen demand and restore confidence with a view to support growth and foster financial stability in order to create high quality jobs and opportunities for all of our citizens. We have agreed today on a coordinated Los Cabos Growth and Jobs Action Plan to achieve those goals.</p>
<p>
	6. Euro Area members of the G20 will take all necessary policy measures to safeguard the integrity and stability of the area, improve the functioning of financial markets and break the feedback loop between sovereigns and banks. We look forward to the Euro Area working in partnership with the next Greek government to ensure they remain on the path to reform and sustainability within the Euro Area.</p>
<p>
	7. We are implementing our structural and regulatory reform agenda to enhance medium-term growth prospects and build more resilient financial systems. We remain committed to reduce imbalances by strengthening deficit countries&rsquo; public finances with sound and sustainable policies that take into account evolving economic conditions and, in countries with large current account surpluses, by strengthening domestic demand and moving toward greater exchange rate flexibility.</p>
<p>
	8. Despite the challenges we all face domestically, we have agreed that multilateralism is of even greater importance in the current climate, and remains our best asset to resolve the global economy&#39;s difficulties.</p>
<p>
	9. Recognizing the impact of the continuing crisis on developing countries, particularly low income countries, we will intensify our efforts to create a more conducive environment for development, including supporting infrastructure investment. Our policy actions will improve living conditions across the globe and protect the most vulnerable. In particular, by stabilizing global markets and promoting stronger growth, we will generate significant positive effects on development and poverty reduction across the globe.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Supporting economic stabilization and the global recovery </strong></p>
<p>
	10. Strong, sustainable and balanced growth remains the top priority of the G20, as it leads to higher job creation and increases the welfare of people across the world. We are committed to adopting all necessary policy measures to strengthen demand, support global growth and restore confidence, address short and medium-term risks, enhance job creation and reduce unemployment, as reflected in the Los Cabos Growth and Jobs Action Plan (see Annex). We will implement all our commitments in a timely manner and rigorously monitor their implementation.</p>
<p>
	11. Against the background of renewed market tensions, Euro Area members of the G20 will take all necessary measures to safeguard the integrity and stability of the area, improve the functioning of financial markets and break the feedback loop between sovereigns and banks. We welcome the significant actions taken since the last summit by the Euro Area to support growth, ensure financial stability and promote fiscal responsibility as a contribution to the G20 framework for strong, sustainable and balanced growth. In this context, we welcome Spain&rsquo;s plan to recapitalize its banking system and the Eurogroup&rsquo;s announcement of support for Spain&rsquo;s financial restructuring authority. The adoption of the Fiscal Compact and its ongoing implementation, together with growth-enhancing policies and structural reform and financial stability measures, are important steps towards greater fiscal and economic integration that lead to sustainable borrowing costs. The imminent establishment of the European Stability Mechanism is a substantial strengthening of the European firewalls. We fully support the actions of the Euro Area in moving forward with the completion of the Economic and Monetary Union. Towards that end, we support the intention to consider concrete steps towards a more integrated financial architecture, encompassing banking supervision, resolution and recapitalization, and deposit insurance. Euro Area members will foster intra Euro Area adjustment through structural reforms to strengthen competitiveness in deficit countries and to promote demand and growth in surplus countries. The European Union members of the G20 are determined to move forward expeditiously on measures to support growth including through completing the European Single Market and making better use of European financial means, such as the European Investment Bank (EIB), pilot project bonds, and structural and cohesion funds, for more targeted investment, employment, growth and competitiveness, while maintaining the firm commitment to implement fiscal consolidation to be assessed on a structural basis. We look forward to the Euro Area working in partnership with the next Greek government to ensure they remain on the path to reform and sustainability within the Euro Area.</p>
<p>
	12. All G20 members will take the necessary actions to strengthen global growth and restore confidence. Advanced economies will ensure that the pace of fiscal consolidation is appropriate to support the recovery, taking country-specific circumstances into account and, in line with the Toronto commitments, address concerns about medium term fiscal sustainability. Those advanced and emerging economies which have fiscal space will let the automatic fiscal stabilizers to operate taking into account national circumstances and current demand conditions. Should economic conditions deteriorate significantly further, those countries with sufficient fiscal space stand ready to coordinate and implement discretionary fiscal actions to support domestic demand, as appropriate. In many countries, higher investment in education, innovation and infrastructure can support the creation of jobs now while raising productivity and future growth prospects. Recognizing the need to pursue growth-oriented policies that support demand and recovery, the United States will calibrate the pace of its fiscal consolidation by ensuring that its public finances are placed on a sustainable long-run path so that a sharp fiscal contraction in 2013 is avoided.</p>
<p>
	13. Monetary policy will maintain price stability over the medium term while continuing to support the economic recovery. We will strengthen confidence in our banks, maintaining momentum on the financial sector reforms needed to safeguard our financial systems over the medium term while taking appropriate actions to protect credit channels and the integrity of the global payment and settlement systems. Healthy banks, with an ability to lend, are critical to the global recovery.</p>
<p>
	14. G20 members will remain vigilant of the evolution of oil prices and will stand ready to carry out additional actions as needed, including the commitment by producing countries to continue to ensure an appropriate level of supply consistent with demand. We welcome Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s readiness to mobilize, as necessary, existing spare capacity to ensure adequate supply. We will also remain vigilant of other commodity prices.</p>
<p>
	15. A number of emerging markets are now also experiencing a slowdown in growth. In response, these countries are appropriately directing monetary and fiscal policies to support growth while ensuring stability and, in some cases, introducing new measures to boost their economies, in particular through strengthening domestic demand in a context of weaker external demand.</p>
<p>
	16. We welcome progress by countries with large current account surpluses to increase domestic demand and actions by countries with large current account deficits to increase national savings. Emerging surplus economies will carry out further actions to increase domestic consumption, including by removing price and tax distortions and strengthening social safety nets, while advanced surplus economies or those with relatively weak private demand will promote domestic demand, notably through the liberalization of service sectors and the promotion of investment, including through the removal of inefficiencies. Higher national savings in countries with current account deficits will contribute to a lasting reduction in global imbalances. We recognize the special circumstances of large commodity exporters with regard to current account surpluses. We reaffirm our commitment to move more rapidly toward market-determined exchange rate systems and exchange rate flexibility to reflect underlying fundamentals, avoid persistent exchange rate misalignments, and refrain from competitive devaluation of currencies. We also welcome the commitment by China to allow market forces to play a larger role in determining movements in the Remnimbi (RMB), continue to reform its exchange rate regime, and to increase the transparency of its exchange rate policy.</p>
<p>
	17. All G20 members have put forward structural reform commitments to strengthen and sustain global demand, foster job creation, contribute to global rebalancing and increase growth potential. These include product market reforms to increase competition, measures to stabilize the housing sector, labor market reforms to boost competitiveness and employment, as well as steps to strengthen social safety nets in a way that is fiscally responsible, advance tax reform to raise productivity, increase investment in infrastructure, and promote inclusive green growth and sustainable development as appropriate to country circumstances. We ask Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors to consider ways in which the G20 can foster investment in infrastructure and ensure the availability of sufficient funding for infrastructure projects, including Multilateral Development Banks&rsquo; (MDBs) financing and technical support.</p>
<p>
	18. In all policy areas, we commit to minimize the negative spillovers on other countries of policies implemented for domestic purposes. We reaffirm our shared interest in a strong and stable international financial system. While capital flows can be beneficial to recipient economies, we reiterate that excess volatility of financial flows and disorderly movements in exchange rates have adverse implications for economic and financial stability.</p>
<p>
	19. Recognizing the importance of transparency and accountability in reinforcing credibility and confidence, we have agreed on the Los Cabos Accountability Assessment Framework that accompanies the Growth and Jobs Action Plan. This Framework establishes the procedures we will follow to report on progress in implementing our policy commitments. We welcome the first Accountability Report under this new framework. We task our Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors to present the second Accountability Report for the Leaders&rsquo; Summit in St. Petersburg in 2013.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Employment and Social Protection </strong></p>
<p>
	20. Quality employment is at the heart of our macroeconomic policies. Jobs with labor rights, social security coverage and decent income contribute to more stable growth, enhance social inclusion and reduce poverty. We therefore endorse the recommendations of our Labor and Employment Ministers to urgently combat unemployment through appropriate labor market measures and fostering the creation of decent work and quality jobs, particularly for youth and other vulnerable groups, who have been severely hit by the economic crisis. We reaffirm our commitment to youth to facilitate their access to quality jobs, which will boost their life prospects. We welcome the work of the G20 Task Force on Employment and extend its mandate for an additional year in the terms proposed by our Ministers. Consistent with the Los Cabos Growth and Jobs Action Plan, we consider that structural reforms, in full respect of the fundamental principles and rights at work, can play an important role in lifting economic growth to generate labor market opportunities, mobility and jobs. We also commit to intensify our efforts to strengthen cooperation in education, skills development and training policies, including internship and on-the-job training, which support a successful school-to-work transition.</p>
<p>
	21. Creating jobs and reducing unemployment, particularly among our youth and those most affected by the crisis, is central to all our countries. We welcome the report by the International Labour Organization (ILO), Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank on boosting jobs and living standards in G20 countries. We will continue to focus on measures to accelerate the pace of the recovery in jobs and the reduction in unemployment.</p>
<p>
	22. We recognize the importance of establishing nationally determined social protection floors. We will continue to foster inter-agency and international policy coherence, coordination, cooperation and knowledge sharing to assist low-income countries in capacity building for implementing nationally determined social protection floors. We ask international organizations to identify policy options with low-income countries on how to develop effective sustainable protection floors.</p>
<p>
	23. We commit to take concrete actions to overcome the barriers hindering women&#39;s full economic and social participation and to expand economic opportunities for women in G20 economies. We also express our firm commitment to advance gender equality in all areas, including skills training, wages and salaries, treatment in the workplace, and responsibilities in care-giving.</p>
<p>
	24. We ask our Labor Ministers to review progress made on this agenda and we welcome consultations with social partners. In this regard, we appreciate the contribution of the Business-20 (B20) and Labor-20 (L20) to the process of the G20 under the Mexican Presidency.</p>
<p>
	25. We recognize the role of travel and tourism as a vehicle for job creation, economic growth and development, and, while recognizing the sovereign right of States to control the entry of foreign nationals, we will work towards developing travel facilitation initiatives in support of job creation, quality work, poverty reduction and global growth.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Trade </strong></p>
<p>
	26. We are firmly committed to open trade and investment, expanding markets and resisting protectionism in all its forms, which are necessary conditions for sustained global economic recovery, jobs and development. We underline the importance of an open, predictable, rules-based, transparent multilateral trading system and are committed to ensure the centrality of the World Trade Organization (WTO).</p>
<p>
	27. Recognizing the importance of investment for boosting economic growth, we commit to maintaining a supportive business environment for investors.</p>
<p>
	28. We are deeply concerned about rising instances of protectionism around the world. Following up our commitment made in Cannes, we reaffirm our standstill commitment until the end of 2014 with regard to measures affecting trade and investment, and our pledge to roll back any new protectionist measure that may have arisen, including new export restrictions and WTO-inconsistent measures to stimulate exports. We also undertake to notify in a timely manner trade and investment restrictive measures. We uphold the inventory and monitoring work of the WTO, OECD and United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) on trade and investment measures and encourage them to reinforce and deepen the work in these areas, consistent with their respective mandates.</p>
<p>
	29. We value the discussion held by our Trade Ministers in Puerto Vallarta on the relevance of regional and global value chains to world trade, recognizing their role in fostering economic growth, employment and development and emphasizing the need to enhance the participation of developing countries in such value chains. We encourage a deepening of these discussions in the WTO, UNCTAD and OECD within their respective mandates, and we call on them to accelerate their work on analyzing the functioning of global value chains and their relationship with trade and investment flows, development and jobs, as well as on how to measure trade flows, to better understand how our actions affect our countries and others, and to report on progress under Russia&#39;s Presidency.</p>
<p>
	30. In line with the Cannes Communiqu&eacute;, we stand by the Doha Development Agenda mandate and reaffirm our commitment to pursue fresh, credible approaches to furthering trade negotiations across the board. We will continue to work towards concluding the Doha Round negotiations, including outcomes in specific areas where progress is possible, such as trade facilitation, and other issues of concern for least developed countries. We urge progress in streamlining WTO accession procedures for the world&rsquo;s poorest countries.</p>
<p>
	31. We support strengthening the WTO through improving the way it conducts its regular business, and its dispute settlement system. We also direct our representatives to further discussions on challenges and opportunities for the multilateral trading system in a globalized economy.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Strengthening the international financial architecture </strong></p>
<p>
	32. We recognize the importance of effective global and regional safety nets. We welcome the firm commitments to increase the resources available to the IMF. This is the result of a broad international cooperative effort that includes a significant number of countries. The commitments exceed $450 billion and are in addition to the quota increase under the 2010 Reform. These resources will be available for the whole membership of the IMF, and not earmarked for any particular region. These resources, which qualify as reserve assets, would be channeled through bilateral loans and investments such as note purchase agreements to the IMF&rsquo;s General Resources Account under the modalities which have been approved by the IMF Executive Board. This effort shows the G20 and the international community&rsquo;s commitment to take the steps needed to safeguard global financial stability and enhance the IMF&rsquo;s role in crisis prevention and resolution.</p>
<p>
	33. We reaffirm our commitment to implement in full the 2010 Quota and Governance Reform by the agreed date of the 2012 IMF/World Bank Annual Meetings. These reforms are crucial to enhancing the IMF&rsquo;s legitimacy, relevance and effectiveness, and will support efforts to further strengthen Fund surveillance and to ensure that the IMF is adequately resourced to play its systemic role. As part of these reforms, we are committed to completing the comprehensive review of the quota formula, to address deficiencies and weaknesses in the current quota formula, by January 2013 and to complete the next general review of quotas by January 2014. We agree that the formula should be simple and transparent, consistent with the multiple roles of quotas, result in calculated shares that are broadly acceptable to the membership, and be feasible to implement based on timely, high quality and widely available data. We reaffirm that the distribution of quotas based on the formula should better reflect the relative weights of IMF members in the world economy, which have changed substantially in view of strong GDP growth in dynamic emerging markets and developing countries. We reaffirm the importance of continuing to protect the voice and representation of the poorest members of the IMF. We ask our Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors to review progress on this issue when they meet in November.</p>
<p>
	34. We agreed that the current surveillance framework should be significantly enhanced, including through a better integration of bilateral and multilateral surveillance with a focus on global, domestic and financial stability, including spillovers from countries&rsquo; policies. We welcome the work of the IMF to advance considerations for a proposed integrated surveillance decision and commit to support the decision process. We underscore the importance of rigorous surveillance on exchange rate policies and support a more ample coverage of surveillance activities, where relevant, including global liquidity, capital flows, capital account measures, reserve and fiscal, monetary and financial sector policies that could have an impact on external stability. We welcome the IMF&rsquo;s ongoing work to produce an external sector report, which would strengthen multilateral analysis and enhance the transparency of surveillance. We also recognize that political ownership and traction is critical to effective surveillance, and that the International Monetary and Financial Committee (IMFC) has a role in facilitating the active involvement of all IMF members. We look forward to substantial progress by the next IMF/World Bank Annual Meetings.</p>
<p>
	35. We welcome the interim progress report and look forward to the joint annual progress report to support the development of local currency bond markets to be prepared by the World Bank, Regional Development Banks, IMF, OECD and the Bank of International Settlements (BIS). The full report will be presented at the November meeting of G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors. This issue is of great importance to emerging markets and developing countries, recognizing that the liquidity, efficiency and operation of these markets are being challenged by the current global financial situation.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Reforming the financial sector and fostering financial inclusion </strong></p>
<p>
	36. We welcome the progress report by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) on taking forward the G20 commitments for strengthening financial stability and the FSB&rsquo;s enhanced monitoring of implementation at the national level. We are committed to the timely, full and consistent implementation of agreed policies in order to support a stable and integrated global financial system and to prevent future crises.</p>
<p>
	37. We welcome the publication of the traffic lights scoreboard to track progress in the implementation of all our financial reform recommendations and pledge to take all necessary actions to make progress in the areas where difficulties in policy development or implementation have been identified.</p>
<p>
	38. In particular, we recognize the substantial progress to date in the priority reform areas identified by the FSB&rsquo;s Coordination Framework for Implementation Monitoring (CFIM): the Basel capital and liquidity framework; the framework for global systemically important financial institutions (G-SIFIs), resolution regimes, over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives reforms, shadow banking, and compensation practices. We commit to complete work in these important areas to achieve full implementation of reforms.</p>
<p>
	39. We reaffirm our commitment that all standardized OTC derivative contracts should be traded on exchanges or electronic trading platforms, where appropriate, and cleared through central counterparties by end-2012, OTC derivative contracts should be reported to trade repositories and non-centrally cleared contracts should be subject to higher capital requirements. We welcome the FSB progress report on implementation. Now that substantial progress has been achieved in the four safeguards for a resilient and efficient global framework for central clearing, jurisdictions should rapidly finalize their decision-making and put in place the needed legislation and regulations to meet the G20 commitment for central clearing. We acknowledge the progress made to develop the key principles to promote internationally consistent minimum standards for the margining of non-centrally cleared derivatives and encourage international standard setters to finalize the proposed global margin standards by the end of this year, to match the implementation deadline for other OTC derivatives reforms and for the Basel capital framework.</p>
<p>
	40. We welcome progress in implementing Basel II, 2.5 and III and urge jurisdictions to fully implement the standards according to the agreed timelines. We welcome the Basel Committee&rsquo;s consultative proposals for a fundamental review of the market risk framework. We welcome the FSB&rsquo;s progress report on the implementation of the principles and standards for sound compensation practices, reaffirm our commitment to ensure that these are followed and ask the FSB to continue its ongoing monitoring.</p>
<p>
	41. We reiterate our commitment to make our national resolution regimes consistent with the FSB Key Attributes of Effective Resolution Regimes so that no bank or other financial institution is &ldquo;too big to fail&rdquo;. To this end, we also support the ongoing elaboration of recovery and resolution plans and institution-specific cross-border cooperation agreements for all G-SIFIs. We reiterate our commitment to strengthen the intensity and effectiveness of the supervision of SIFIs and ask the FSB to report on further progress in this area to the November 2012 G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors&rsquo; meeting.</p>
<p>
	42. We welcome progress on developing a set of principles as a common framework for the identification of, and policy measures relating to, domestic systemically important banks (D-SIBs) and ask our Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors to review recommendations in these areas at their meeting in November. We support continuing work for the strengthening of the oversight and regulation of the shadow banking system, and look forward to our Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors reviewing recommendations in these areas at their meeting in November. We ask the FSB in consultation with the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) to complete their work on identification and policy measures for global systemically important insurers by April 2013. Towards reducing systemic risk, we look forward to the preparation by the FSB in consultation with International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) of methodologies to identify other systemically important non-bank financial entities by end-2012 and call on Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems (CPSS) and IOSCO to continue their work on systemically important market infrastructures. We also ask the IAIS to continue its work to develop a common framework for the supervision of internationally active insurance groups by end-2013.</p>
<p>
	43. We call for accelerated progress by national authorities and standard setting bodies in ending the mechanistic reliance on credit ratings and encourage steps that would enhance transparency of and competition among credit rating agencies. We support continuing work to achieve convergence to a single set of high-quality accounting standards. We welcome IOSCO&rsquo;s report on the functioning of the credit default swap markets and ask IOSCO to report on next steps by the November 2012 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors&rsquo; meeting.</p>
<p>
	44. We endorse the FSB recommendations regarding the framework for development of a global legal entity identifier (LEI) system for parties to financial transactions, with a global governance framework representing the public interest. The LEI system will be launched by March 2013 and we ask the FSB to report on implementation progress by the November 2012 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors&rsquo; meeting. We encourage global adoption of the LEI to support authorities and market participants in identifying and managing financial risks.</p>
<p>
	45. We welcome the FSB study, prepared in coordination with the IMF and the World Bank, to identify potential unintended consequences of the agreed financial regulatory reforms for Emerging Markets and Developing Economies (EMDEs). We encourage continued monitoring analysis and reporting by the FSB and dialogue among the FSB, standard-setters, international financial institutions and national authorities of EMDEs, to address material unintended consequences as appropriate without prejudice to our commitment to implement the agreed reforms.</p>
<p>
	46. We endorse the recommendations and the revised FSB Charter for placing the FSB on an enduring organizational footing, with legal personality, strengthened governance, greater financial autonomy and enhanced capacity to coordinate the development and implementation of financial regulatory policies, while maintaining strong links with the BIS. We call for a full implementation of the recommendations by our next meeting and substantial progress by the November 2012 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors&rsquo; meeting. We call on the FSB to continue to keep under review the structure of its representation.</p>
<p>
	47. We welcome the ongoing work by the FSB on adherence to supervisory and regulatory information exchange and cooperation standards and look forward to a further public statement on progress under the initiative ahead of the Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors&rsquo; meeting in November 2012.</p>
<p>
	48. In the tax area, we reiterate our commitment to strengthen transparency and comprehensive exchange of information. We commend the progress made as reported by the Global Forum and urge all countries to fully comply with the standard and implement the recommendations identified in the course of the reviews, in particular the 13 jurisdictions whose framework does not allow them to qualify to phase 2 at this stage. We expect the Global Forum to quickly start examining the effectiveness of information exchange practices and to report to us and our finance ministers. We welcome the OECD report on the practice of automatic information exchange, where we will continue to lead by example in implementing this practice. We call on countries to join this growing practice as appropriate and strongly encourage all jurisdictions to sign the Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance. We also welcome the efforts to enhance interagency cooperation to tackle illicit flows including the outcomes of the Rome meeting of the Oslo Dialogue. We reiterate the need to prevent base erosion and profit shifting and we will follow with attention the ongoing work of the OECD in this area.</p>
<p>
	49. We support the renewal of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) mandate, thereby sustaining global efforts to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorism and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. G20 members also welcome the adoption of the revised FATF standards and look forward to their implementation. We welcome the progress made by FATF in identifying and monitoring high-risk jurisdictions with strategic Anti-Money Laundering/Counter-Terrorist Financing (AML/CFT) deficiencies, using AML/CFT tools in the fight against corruption, improving transparency of corporate vehicles and increasing cooperation against tax crimes, addressing the risks posed by tax havens, as well as in increasing the reach and the effectiveness of AML/CFT measures by also considering financial inclusion efforts. We look forward to the completion in 2013 of the update of the FATF assessment process for the next round of mutual evaluations.</p>
<p>
	50. We welcome the progress made by the Global Partnership for Financial Inclusion (GPFI) on implementing the five recommendations set out in its 2011 report and call on the GPFI to continue working towards their full implementation. We endorse the G20 Basic Set of financial inclusion indicators developed by the GPFI. Recognizing the key role that SMEs play in economic development, and poverty reduction, we welcome the launch of the SME Finance Compact that will support developing innovative models and approaches to address the specific access to finance challenges and constraints faced by developing countries with regards to SME finance. We welcome the forthcoming GPFI conference on standard setting bodies and financial inclusion as a means of helping to create an enabling regulatory environment, and we call on the GPFI to report progress to our Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors in November. Finally, we support the ongoing effort to create a fourth GPFI subgroup that will focus on consumer protection and financial literacy issues.</p>
<p>
	51. We acknowledge the efforts of those G20 and non-G20 countries committed to national coordination platforms and strategies for financial inclusion under the &ldquo;G20 Financial Inclusion Peer Learning Program&rdquo; and encourage similar efforts to advance effective implementation of the G20 Principles for Innovative Financial Inclusion such as the commitments to concrete actions to promote financial inclusion made by developing and emerging countries under the Maya Declaration, recognizing the ongoing efforts and the support by the World Bank Group and the Alliance for Financial Inclusion, and other stakeholders including the United Nations (UN), and bilateral donors to foster financial inclusion.</p>
<p>
	52. On financial education, we endorse the OECD/International Network on Financial Education (INFE) High Level Principles on National Strategies for Financial Education, and call on the OECD/INFE and the World Bank in cooperation with the GPFI to deliver further tools to promote financial education, with a progress report to the next Summit. For advancing the financial consumer protection agenda, we take note of the discussion on the Statutes of the International Financial Consumer Protection Network (FinCoNet) and on the issues of formal structure and financial support to ensure the exchange of best practices. We also endorse the Action Plan presented by the G20/OECD Task Force on Financial Consumer Protection to develop effective approaches to support the implementation of the High Level Principles on Financial Consumer Protection, and look forward to an update report by the Leaders&rsquo; Summit in St. Petersburg in 2013.</p>
<p>
	53. We recognize the need for women and youth to gain access to financial services and financial education, ask the GPFI, the OECD/INFE, and the World Bank to identify barriers they may face and call for a progress report to be delivered by the next Summit.</p>
<p>
	54. We welcome the launch of the Mexico Financial Inclusion Challenge: Innovative Solutions for Unlocking Access, a call for innovations that address barriers to financial inclusion through the creation of valuable, affordable, secure, and comprehensive financial services.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Enhancing food security and addressing commodity price volatility </strong></p>
<p>
	55. The Action Plan on Food Price Volatility and Agriculture adopted by the Ministers of Agriculture in 2011 underlined that to feed a world population expected to exceed 9.3 billion by 2050, agricultural production will have to increase between 50 and 70 percent, and by almost 100 percent in developing countries. We recognize that increasing production and productivity on a sustainable basis while considering the diversity of agricultural conditions is one of the most important challenges that the world faces today. The crisis in the Sahel and the Horn of Africa also underscores that strengthening emergency and long-term responses to food insecurity remains a pressing challenge. We also note that chronic malnutrition is an enormous drain on a country&rsquo;s human resources, and we therefore support the Scaling Up Nutrition movement and encourage wider involvement of G20 members.</p>
<p>
	56. We welcome the considerable progress made in implementing the Action Plan and the food security pillar of the Seoul Multi-Year Action Plan on Development. We support the G20 Agriculture Vice-Ministers&rsquo; Report annexed to this Declaration, on the progress made on previous commitments and key recommendations on sustainably increasing agricultural productivity, containing inputs from several international organizations coordinated by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the OECD, in addition to other recommendations from B20 and civil society.</p>
<p>
	<em>57. </em>To fight hunger, we commit to continue our efforts on our initiatives, including the Tropical Agriculture Platform, the Platform for Agricultural Risk Management, the GEO Global Agriculture Monitoring, research initiatives for wheat, rice and corn, the Rapid Response Forum, regional emergency food reserves, the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program and support for the Principles of Responsible Agriculture Investment. Recognizing the important contribution of greater transparency to reducing food price volatility, we welcome the progress made in the implementation of the Agricultural Market Information System (AMIS). We recognize that a more stable, predictable, distortion-free, open and transparent trading system, including as regards agriculture, has a critical role to play to promote food security.</p>
<p>
	58. We reaffirm our commitment to remove export restrictions and extraordinary taxes on food purchased for non-commercial humanitarian purposes by the World Food Programme (WFP). We encourage the implementation of the Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible Governance of Tenure of Land, Fisheries and Forests in the Context of National Food Security.</p>
<p>
	59. We strongly welcome the launch of the &ldquo;AgResults&rdquo; Initiative, aimed at improving food security for the poor and vulnerable by encouraging private sector innovation of new agricultural products and systems constrained by market failures in agriculture. We look forward to the launch of the pilot projects focused on innovations in nutrient-fortified crops, post-harvest waste-reducing storage solutions and crop quality technologies in Sub-Saharan Africa. We commend those who have already committed or signaled their intention to commit funding to this initiative and encourage broader participation.</p>
<p>
	60. We recognize the need to adapt agriculture to climate change and we recognize the importance of improving the efficiency of water and soil use in a sustainable manner. To this end, we support the development of and a greater use of available technologies, well-known practices and techniques such as soil fertility enhancement, minimum tillage and agroforestry, and call upon international organizations to provide a report on science-based options to improve the efficiency of water use in agriculture including in ways particularly suitable for small farms.</p>
<p>
	61. We recognize the importance to the global economic recovery of maintaining stability in international commodity markets. We stress the importance of well-functioning and transparent physical and financial commodities&rsquo; markets and reduced excessive price volatility to achieve food security and strong growth that is both sustainable and inclusive. We recognize that excessive commodity price volatility has significant implications for all countries, increasing uncertainty for actors in the economy and potentially hampering stability of the budgets, and predictability of economic planning. We recognize that mitigating the negative effects of commodity price volatility on the most vulnerable is an important component of reducing poverty and boosting economic growth. We therefore endorse the conclusions of the G20 report on the macroeconomic impacts of excessive commodity price volatility on growth and its identification of policy options that countries could consider, taking account of national circumstances to mitigate any such effect. We also acknowledge and appreciate the participation and valuable inputs of the IMF, World Bank and UNCTAD. We ask our Finance Ministers to report in 2013 on progress on the G20&rsquo;s contribution to facilitate better functioning of these physical markets, taking note of possible areas of further work outlined in the report. We reaffirm our commitment to enhance transparency and avoid abuse in financial commodity markets, including OTC, with effective intervention powers for market regulators and authorities and an appropriate regulation and supervisory framework. In this regard we look forward to IOSCO&rsquo;s report on the implementation of its recommendations on commodity derivatives markets by November 2012.</p>
<p>
	62. We recognize that excessive price volatility in energy commodities is also an important source of economic instability. We remain committed to well-functioning and transparent energy markets. We will continue to work to improve the timeliness, completeness and reliability of JODI-Oil and look forward to a progress report next year. We will work on the JODI-Gas database on the same principles. We expect the International Energy Forum (IEF) report on improving the reliability of the JODI-Oil database and the report on transparency in international gas and coal markets submitted by the International Energy Agency (IEA), IEF, and Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to be discussed by our Finance Ministers in November. We also look forward to IOSCO&rsquo;s recommendations to improve the functioning and oversight of Price Reporting Agencies in November 2012, which will be produced in collaboration with other mandated organizations (IEF, IEA and OPEC), and task Finance Ministers to take concrete measures in this area as necessary.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Meeting the Challenges of Development </strong></p>
<p>
	63. Eradicating poverty and achieving strong, inclusive, sustainable and balanced growth remain core objectives of the G20 development agenda. We reaffirm our commitment to work with developing countries, particularly low income countries, and to support them in implementing the nationally driven policies and priorities which are needed to fulfill internationally agreed development goals, particularly the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and beyond.</p>
<p>
	64. We welcome the initiative of the Development Working Group to build upon the work of previous G20 presidencies, and its focus on three priorities during the Mexican Presidency - food security, infrastructure and inclusive green growth. We commend the progress achieved against our commitments in the Seoul Multi-Year Action Plan, and support the 2012 Development Working Group progress report annexed to this Declaration. We invite the Development Working Group to explore putting in place a process for ensuring assessment and accountability for G20 development actions by the next Summit.</p>
<p>
	65. Investment in infrastructure is critical for sustained economic growth, poverty reduction, and job creation. We therefore welcome the strong progress made under the Multi-Year Action Plan, including in implementing the recommendations of the Multilateral Development Banks&rsquo; (MDBs) Action Plan and the High Level Panel on Infrastructure.</p>
<p>
	66. While recognizing that public financing of infrastructure development projects in developing countries remains essential, we consider it should be complemented by private sector investment. We encourage MDBs to continue progress under the Action Plan, and welcome the report on addressing Misperception of Risk and Return in Low Income Countries. This contains important messages about properly perceiving the risks posed, as well as the opportunities offered, by long-term infrastructure investment in low income countries. Recognizing the challenge that rapid urbanization poses and the need to make cities more sustainable, we welcome the report on Best Practices for Urban Mass Transport Infrastructure Projects in Medium and Large Cities in Developing Countries, and support the follow-up actions as set out in the Development Working Group report.</p>
<p>
	67. We reaffirm our commitments to the global partnership for development, as set out in the MDGs, and welcome efforts to contribute to this end, including the Global Partnership for Effective Development Cooperation to be launched with voluntary participation under the auspices of the broad consensus achieved at the 4th High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness held in Busan, Korea.</p>
<p>
	68. We recognize the value of Disaster Risk Management (DRM) tools and strategies to better prevent disasters, protect populations and assets, and financially manage their economic impacts. We appreciate World Bank and OECD combined efforts, with the UN&rsquo;s support, to provide inputs and broaden participation in the discussion on DRM. We welcome the World Bank&rsquo;s and Mexico&rsquo;s joint publication on country experiences in this area with the support of G20 members, and look forward to the OECD voluntary framework to facilitate implementation of DRM strategies, to be completed by November.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Promoting longer-term prosperity through inclusive green growth </strong></p>
<p>
	69. The long-term development and prosperity of current and future generations requires us to look beyond the immediate economic crisis. We acknowledge the importance of finding ways in which economic growth, environmental protection and social inclusion can complement and reinforce each other. Inclusive green growth in the context of sustainable development and poverty eradication can help achieve our development and economic goals, while protecting our environment, and improving social well-being on which our future depends. Inclusive green growth should not be used to introduce protectionist measures.</p>
<p>
	70. We commit to continue to help developing countries sustain and strengthen their development through appropriate measures, including those that encourage inclusive green growth. We will reaffirm our commitment to sustainable development at the 2012 United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20). We commit to maintaining a focus on inclusive green growth as part of our G20 agenda and in the light of agreements reached at Rio+20 and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).</p>
<p>
	71. Climate change will continue to have a significant impact on the world economy, and costs will be higher to the extent we delay additional action. We reiterate our commitment to fight climate change and welcome the outcome of the 17th Conference of the Parties to the UN climate change conferences. We are committed to the full implementation of the outcomes of Cancun and Durban and will work with Qatar as the incoming Presidency towards achieving a successful and balanced outcome at COP-18. We emphasize the need to structurally transform economies towards a climate-friendly path over the medium term. We welcome the creation of the G20 study group on climate finance, in order to consider ways to effectively mobilize resources taking into account the objectives, provisions and principles of the UNFCCC in line with the Cancun Agreement and ask to provide a progress report to Finance Ministers in November. We support the operationalization of the Green Climate Fund.</p>
<p>
	72. The Development Working Group discussed a broad set of practical, voluntary measures and actions that have the potential to help countries define their paths towards sustainable development based on their own circumstances and priorities. We believe that developing countries should have access to institutions and mechanisms that can facilitate knowledge sharing, resource mobilization and building technical and institutional capacity to design and implement inclusive green growth strategies and policies. We welcome international efforts in launching the Green Growth Knowledge Platform and will continue exploring options to provide appropriate support to interested developing countries. We welcome the delivery of a non-prescriptive, voluntary toolkit of policy options for inclusive green growth and encourage efforts to promote its implementation. We encourage further exploration of effective mechanisms to mobilize public and private funds for inclusive green growth investment in developing countries, including through the public-private Dialogue Platform on Inclusive Green Investments. We welcome the B20&rsquo;s Green Growth Action Alliance.</p>
<p>
	73. We highlight that green growth and sustainable development have strong potential to stimulate long term prosperity and well being. We welcome the report prepared by the OECD, the World Bank and the UN on incorporating green growth and sustainable development policies into structural reform agendas, tailored to specific country conditions and level of development. We also acknowledge the G20 efforts to voluntarily self-report on current actions taken to integrate green growth and sustainable development into structural reform agendas. We will self-report again in 2013, on a voluntary basis, and ask appropriate officials to report back on countries&rsquo; efforts and progress on incorporating green growth policies in structural reform agendas and in relevant national plans to promote sustainable development.</p>
<p>
	74. We welcome the progress report on fossil fuel subsidies, and we reaffirm our commitment to rationalize and phase out inefficient fossil fuel subsides that encourage wasteful consumption over the medium term while providing targeted support for the poorest. We ask Finance Ministers to report back by the next Summit on progress made, and acknowledging the relevance of accountability and transparency, to explore options for a voluntary peer review process for G20 members by their next meeting. We also welcome a dialogue on fossil fuel subsidies with other groups already engaged in this work.</p>
<p>
	75. In Cannes we committed to promote low-carbon development strategies in order to optimize the potential for green growth and ensure sustainable development in our countries and beyond. We therefore welcome the report on clean energy and energy efficiency technologies and acknowledge the G20 countries&rsquo; efforts to foster investment in these technologies through the sharing of national experiences regarding challenges for technology deployment.</p>
<p>
	76. We welcome the establishment of a Global Marine Environment Protection Best Practices Sharing Mechanism website, and look forward to its launch in accordance with the Cannes mandate.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Intensifying the fight against corruption </strong></p>
<p>
	77. Corruption impedes economic growth, threatens the integrity of markets, undermines fair competition, distorts resource allocation, destroys public trust and undermines the rule of law. We call on all relevant stakeholders to play an active role in fighting corruption.</p>
<p>
	78. Closing the implementation and enforcement gap remains an important priority, and we continue to make significant progress towards the full implementation of the Seoul G20 Anti-Corruption Action Plan, and the commitments made in the Cannes Monitoring Report. We reiterate our commitment to the ratification and full implementation of the United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC), and to more active engagement with the OECD working group on bribery on a voluntary basis. We welcome continuing engagement from the B20 in the fight against corruption and, in accordance with the Terms of Reference of the review mechanism, will involve the private sector and civil society in the UNCAC review process on a voluntary basis. We endorse today the G20 Anti-Corruption Working Group principles for denial of entry to our countries of corrupt officials, and those who corrupt them, and will continue to develop frameworks for cooperation. We also endorse the Working Group&rsquo;s principles for financial and asset disclosure systems for relevant officials to prevent, identify and appropriately manage conflicts of interest.</p>
<p>
	79. We commit to enforcing anti-corruption legislation, and we will pursue those who receive and solicit bribes as well as those who pay them in line with our countries&rsquo; legislation. To help facilitate international cooperation among G20 and non-G20 governments in their investigation and prosecution of corruption, we will publish a guide on Mutual Legal Assistance from G20 countries, as well as information on tracing assets in G20 jurisdictions. We renew our commitment to deny safe haven to the proceeds of corruption and to the recovery and restitution of stolen assets.</p>
<p>
	80. We extend the mandate of the Anti-Corruption Working Group for two years to the end of 2014 and request the Working Group to prepare a comprehensive action plan, as well as a second Working Group Monitoring Report, both to be presented for consideration and adoption by Sherpas by the end of 2012.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Other paragraphs </strong></p>
<p>
	81. In light of the interconnectedness of the world economy, the G20 has led to a new paradigm of multilateral co-operation that is necessary in order to tackle current and future challenges effectively. The informal and flexible character of the G20 enables it to facilitate international economic and financial cooperation, and address the challenges confronting the global economy. It is important that we continue to further improve the transparency and effectiveness of the G20, and ensure that it is able to respond to pressing needs. As a contribution to this, in line with the commitment made in Cannes, Sherpas have developed a set of evolving G20 working practices.</p>
<p>
	82. An informal meeting of G20 Ministers of Foreign Affairs was held in Los Cabos in February, which explored the ways in which G20 member countries could contribute more effectively to address key challenges in global governance.</p>
<p>
	83. Recognizing the far-reaching impact of G20 decisions, we welcome the extensive outreach efforts undertaken by the Mexican Presidency, including the meetings of Business-20, Labor-20, Youth-20, and Think-20. We will continue developing efforts with non-members, regional and international organizations, including the UN and other actors. In line with the Cannes mandate, in order to ensure our outreach remains consistent and effective, we welcome a set of principles in this area, developed by Sherpas.</p>
<p>
	84. We thank international organizations, including the UN, IMF, World Bank, WTO, FSB, ILO, FAO, and OECD, as well as civil society, for their input into the G20 process. Their reports and recommendations have provided valuable inputs to G20 discussions, in areas ranging from sustainable development to financial regulation.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion </strong></p>
<p>
	85. We look forward to the rest of the work that will take place during Mexico&rsquo;s Presidency until November 30. On 1 December, 2012, Russia will start chairing the G20. We will convene in St. Petersburg, under the Chairmanship of Russia. We thank Mexico for hosting a successful Los Cabos Summit.</p>

They discussed the importance of moving toward a political transition in Syria that ends bloodshed and brings about a government that reflects the will of the Syrian people.&nbsp; They also discussed the situation in Iraq, and agreed on their support for its unity. They reviewed the need to enhance counterterrorism cooperation. They also noted the upcoming Framework for Strategic Economic and Commercial Cooperation (FSECC) meeting in Ankara,&nbsp; which will advance commercial ties between our countries to the benefit of both of our peoples.</p>

<p>
	SECRETARY GEITHNER:&nbsp; We&#39;re encouraged by what we&#39;ve heard from the European leaders today and by the broad focus around the world we&#39;re seeing to the need to strengthen economic growth.</p>
<p>
	The leaders of the G20 met here at obviously what&#39;s a challenging time for the global economy, and this matters a lot to the United States because, because of the crisis in European and the softness you&#39;re seeing in growth outside Europe, that means that in the U.S. we&#39;re not growing as fast as we need to grow.</p>
<p>
	Now, the leaders today discussed a broad range of reforms and priorities.&nbsp; They reviewed progress on trade, on development, on financial reform and energy.&nbsp; But the focus of the meetings were very much on the crisis in Europe and these broader challenges to economic growth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	And the leaders in Europe are working towards the summit they have at the end of next week.&nbsp; It&#39;s going to be really a critical summit for them.&nbsp; And what they&#39;re trying to do is to design a framework to not just make Europe stronger for the future with reforms to build a stronger set of institutions for fiscal union --&nbsp; banking union -- that&#39;s the way they describe it -- not just to make sure these economic reforms work over time to strengthen growth in Europe, but what they&#39;re also trying to do is to make sure in the very near term they&#39;re putting in place a set of measures that can help make sure that they&#39;re supporting the financial systems of Europe and they are helping make sure that countries that are undertaking these reforms -- like Spain and Italy -- can borrow at existing low interest rates.</p>
<p>
	Both those two things are very important -- not just the long-term reforms to build a stronger Europe, but the immediate steps to make sure that they&#39;re stabilizing their financial systems and making sure these reforms can really work.</p>
<p>
	Now, they&#39;ve laid out a framework with a series of very important key elements, and let me just describe those key elements for you -- and you&#39;re going to hear the European leaders speak to those specific changes.</p>
<p>
	First, they all want to work in partnership with Greece to make sure that Greece is reforming within the European community. That&#39;s very important.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Second, they are designing, as I said, the elements of what they call a financial architecture for a stronger framework to make their financial system work.&nbsp; And what this means is a framework of reforms so they can stand behind their banks, provide capital to the banks that need it, make sure they&#39;re protecting the savings of their depositors.&nbsp; That&#39;s the second key thing -- this focus on banking union or a broader financial architecture -- financial union.</p>
<p>
	You saw Spain move -- and it&#39;s a very good thing they did this -- to make sure they&#39;re committed, to make sure they can get some support of the capital -- the banks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	And the third thing is the focus on economic growth, because of course, for these reforms to work in Europe over time, Europe needs to grow faster.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	As I said, you&#39;re going to hear more from the European leaders in the coming days about the specific proposals they&#39;re going to put in place.&nbsp; They&#39;re negotiating towards an agreement at their summit at the end of next week.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Now, a solution to this crisis in Europe has got to be made in Europe.&nbsp; And all of us, of course, have a huge interest, a huge stake in the success of their efforts.&nbsp; And we&#39;re going to continue to do everything we can to support them.</p>
<p>
	Thank you.</p>

	The transatlantic relationship is the world&rsquo;s largest economic relationship, accounting for half of global economic output and nearly one trillion dollars in goods and services trade and supporting millions of jobs on both sides of the Atlantic.</p>
<p>
	Still, there is more to be done to deepen and broaden our ties.</p>
<p>
	Particularly at this time, a bold initiative to expand trade and investment could make a significant contribution to our strategy to strengthen growth and create jobs.</p>
<p>
	In that regard, we received the Interim Report of the High Level Working Group on Jobs and Growth, and welcomed the Group&#39;s thorough assessment of all the options to achieve that objective.</p>
<p>
	We are encouraged by the Report&#39;s analysis of the benefits of an ambitious and comprehensive market opening arrangement for agricultural and manufactured goods, services and investment, the identification of ways to promote compatible regulatory approaches, and tackle behind-the-border barriers, and possible approaches to intellectual property rights.</p>
<p>
	A strong outcome can enhance not only transatlantic economic ties, but also address shared market access challenges in third countries and encourage a forward-looking multilateral trade liberalization agenda.</p>
<p>
	We therefore urge the Group to complete its work as quickly as possible, including consultations with public and private stakeholders, in accordance with the respective processes of both sides, with the goal of reaching a recommendation to Leaders later this year on a decision as to the negotiations.</p>

	President Obama and Prime Minister Harper today welcomed the announcement by the nine Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) countries to incorporate Canada into the TPP negotiations.&nbsp; The current TPP countries are Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Chile, Malaysia, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, the United States and Vietnam.</p>
<p>
	The TPP countries are seeking to conclude a high-ambition, next-generation regional agreement that liberalizes trade and investment and addresses new and traditional trade issues and 21st-century challenges.&nbsp; As longstanding proponents of enhancing trade and economic relations with countries around the Asia Pacific, the United States and Canada share a common goal of concluding the TPP agreement expeditiously, which will promote innovation, support the creation and retention of jobs in our economies and contribute to the growth of our highly integrated&nbsp; economies.</p>
<p>
	The United States and Canada have the largest single market bilateral trading relationship in the world.&nbsp; Canada is the top export destination for U.S. goods ($280.9 billion in 2011) and services ($56 billion in 2011) and is the top export destination for 35 U.S. states.&nbsp; At the U.S.-Canada border, nearly $1 million in goods and services cross every minute.&nbsp; Every day 300,000 people cross for business, tourism, or to maintain family ties.&nbsp; The United States and Canada welcome the TPP as an opportunity to further build upon this already dynamic trading relationship and create new opportunities for our businesses, consumers, farmers, ranchers, and manufacturers across the Asia-Pacific region.</p>
<p>
	The United States and Canada have been partners in free trade since 1988, and the secure and predictable access to each other&#39;s markets has supported thousands of jobs and business relationships over many decades.&nbsp; Together we negotiated and have signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement.&nbsp; Earlier this year, the United States and Canada agreed to take new steps to further deepen our economic relationship through important initiatives like the Action Plan on Perimeter Security and Economic Competiveness and the Joint Action Plan on Regulatory Cooperation.&nbsp; In 2010, we negotiated a bilateral government procurement agreement marking an important expansion of reciprocal access to our procurement markets below the federal level.</p>
<p>
	The TPP presents an opportunity to conclude a high standard agreement that will build on the commitments of NAFTA.</p>
