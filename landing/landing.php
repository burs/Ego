			You use Internet to gain information about your interests.
...and you visit many, many websites to gain such information.

But have you ever thought about this:
Why visit websites? Are they your ultimate purpose of using the Internet?

Websites are just means to get information about your interests.
Now is the time to get right into your real goal: Interests.

Ego makes it easier for you to receive information about your interests. 
There is no need to go through hundreds of websites everyday.

Just discover, subscribe, and keep your interest - all in one place - on Ego.

			Welcome to your new Internet.

	<div id="contents_feed">
		<div class="contents_title">Feed</div>
		<div class="contents_blurb">Subscribe to your interests</div>
		<div class="contents_text">
			What are you interested in? Technology? K-Pop? Ferrari? 
Whatever it is, just subscribe to your interests with a simple click.
From general subjects like "Technology" to something as specific as "iPhone jailbreak," you will be updated with the latest information about your interest every minute. On Ego's Feed.

Information you receive on Internet is not just news. This is why Ego is not a simple news reader. You can find information of all sorts - from data and shopping mall entries to user forum posts and chats on social network. Interested in iPhone? Subscribing will open your mind to latest news, offers, and even nearby vendors and current used prices, or what other people are talking about.

Sometimes you ask, do I need all of these information? Of course not, so you can filter through only the popular articles, or select just the topics that you want to know more about.

	<div id="contents_fpage">
		<div class="contents_title">Front Page</div>
		<div class="contents_blurb">Discover your interests</div>
		<div class="contents_text">
			Sometimes you don't know what your interest is, or may be you want to find new interests.
Front Page is where you can find new interests that other people are interested in.

See what are the most popular articles on the Internet - of all kinds of topics: Technology, Music, Soccer, and so on. Just like our feeds, you will be introduced to information of all sorts, not just news - from blog posts and shopping mall items to social network updates and threads.

What topics are your friends interested in right now? What about feeds people are interested nearby? All of your thirsting questions can be answered on Now@, where you can see trending keywords from around the world, nation, friends, or nearby. 

Discover what other sources you might be interested in - interested in Technology? How about Engadget? The Verge? Gizmodo? Front Page will recommend new websites and sources that you might add as your "friend."

		<div class="contents_title">Clips</div>
		<div class="contents_blurb">Keep your interests</div>
		<div class="contents_text">
			So you found an article that you love. You can add that article to your personal Clip - through which you can create your personal collage of articles related to your interests. Whether it is a news entry about the latest iPhone rumor, funny joke on 9gag, chic Ferrari cologne on Amazon, or your girlfriend's social network status, you can add them all to your collection.

But, let's not be selfish. Let's share some love - of information. You can share articles with your friend by sending the article to your friends' clip, or their social network accounts like Facebook, Twitter, and Google+.

We all love stalking. You can look at your friends' clips - see what they like, and perhaps you can add an article that you like on your friends' clip to your clip as well. It is also true, however, that we hate being "stalked." You can easily mark your articles as Private with a simple click of a button. It's a win-win for everyone.
